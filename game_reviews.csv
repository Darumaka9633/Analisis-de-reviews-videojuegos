Juego,Review
Grand Theft Auto V,"Gta Online: What was a REALISTISCHES Game at first ... Where you accompany your Character on his Way as he completes missions and earns money to buy a nice Apartment has recently evolved into a Game about the ABSOLUTEN MEGALOMANIA. 
For example, at that Time the Adder (bugatti veyron) was the most popular Car in the Game and the most expensive and if you saw someone who drove him you knew that the one had ordaically ""Cash in the Täsch"" yet this changed unfortunately and cars became more expensive and Real estate ever crazier When you Join a Server these days, you'll find pretty much the following: You're standing in a place ... Where you might look at the mobile phone first and you want to transfer the Money you have, you hear it popping ... What happened? Another player drives you over without reason and shoots you without being able to get up. 
Since the update, it is also extremely common that one is killed by one of the new FLIEGENDEN Motorcycles or simply taken away by an Orbital satellite during a Mission. So around 500,000$ ... But this is for most Players no problem about 95% of Players have not earned their Money honestly.
They have been given the Money by Modders or have multiplied It using Explode methods it is really sad that such an unrealistic and unfortunately broken Game has become full of Modders and Idiots.
As for Rockstar's anticheat measures, these have failed across the Board, you see more People with a player level in The multi-digit dog range than ever before and Players who want to work out the Money honestly are doomed to be in Solo Sessions To grin missions to keep up with the others."
Grand Theft Auto V,"Now I also have to give up my Mustard to GTA V.
SinglePlayer: The Game is typically GTA like simply horny and makes you feel Like it. Carts steal and mop up, trade on the Stock market (which gets a bit rogue with Time) and the Heists you can often pull through in several different Ways. Add to that the Special Abilities of each Character and the typical Open-World Feeling.
In short: Must Whim and is a clear Buy recommendation Multiplayer For those who don't have it yet: Honestly, I have no Idea what Rockstar thought, but I think it was purely about coal. As a Beginner, you have hardly any Opportunities to afford even a little, especially if you play alone and no umpteen Friends to pull you along. Will be boring in the Long run.
Worst Of all, though, are all the Kiddies that (almost all) had SxX with my Mum and howl unFlemish, and especially all the Cheaters. You are shot by a wandering PIXEL. Gaaaanz Big Cinema! As a Beginner, you are a Free Wlid for all The Idiots who go hunting With Tanks, Planes and heavy Weapons. Or you suddenly get Millions from an Unknown-and then get kicked by the oh so infallible Anti-cheat system and, if necessary, blocked it, as you got illegal InGame money. Suuper! Motivation high 10 so to speak:-/
All the Updates are only available to buy even more Cash Cards, because as a normal mortal you can't buy the whole stuff anyway.
In Summary, you have to say: If you want to play the game as a Single-player, you should strike when it is in the Sale, for example (like me). If YOU want to play MP, choose another Game, there are really better ones than the whole Pay-to-Win Remembrance here.
And how to rate now? Difficult. SinglePlayer I highly recommend, but since only updates come out for the MP there are a fummy Down.
Sorry, Rock Star, but you guys are too Money hungry for me."
Grand Theft Auto V,"A fun story with 3 memorable characters, a fun world to mess around in and apparently the multiplayer is based"
Grand Theft Auto V,yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooit good
Grand Theft Auto V,"I only recommend half of this game. If you're interested in primarily the online, do not get your hopes up. It is extremely grindy and monetized like a free to play game. Most missions are bland and largely not worth doing from both a reward and fun perspective. Lobbies are also plagued with griefers and hackers.<br/><br/>Now onto the good half, story mode. Story mode offers a fun narrative with decent set pieces. The structure of the game does feel dated though. I know the game is called Grand theft Auto but there is so much brain dead driving back and forth, only being made somewhat bearable when dialogue is happening. Almost every mission, you need to drive to, then watch a cutscene, then drive somewhere else to do some shooting (or some other set piece); rinse and repeat. However, when you are not doing an excessive amount of driving, the missions are pretty enjoyable. Side missions though are a mixed bag. Some are good and others you're driving a slow tow truck to cover someone's job. Despite, all my gripes I still had a very good time with this game and I'd like to attribute this to the larger than life characters, heists, and set pieces."
Grand Theft Auto V,"Kind of a modern classic. Whether playing the entire story is worth it, its undoubtedly influential and a pinnacle of open world destruction fun."
Grand Theft Auto V,"I hate to give this game an exceptional, since it has changed rockstar from a video game company to a gtaonline company, but like damn.  This game is so good, both the single player and the online get an exceptional from me."
Grand Theft Auto V,If you play the stroy you're going to enjoy it so much. The plot is very interesting and it maintains you hooked to the game. The secondary missions are enjoyable and they give you some more lore to the title. The online is not the best part at all but you can try it with some friends to be a little bit more fun. It gave me 44 hours of action and fun.
Grand Theft Auto V,A must-play game for everyone. GTA 5 is so dynamic that will always feel yourself driving and chilling on roads.
Grand Theft Auto V,The latest Grand Theft Auto game continues to have it's name driven further and further into the mud by it's online counterpart's predatory practices but the singleplayer remains as unapologetic and purely fun as it ever was. The game is an explosive heist movie that encourages destruction but knows when to tone down the wackiness and insert some real character moments. You can say what you want but the fact that I know Los Santos's downtown district and Bay Area better than I know my own city's streets despite living here my whole life is testament to its greatness.
Grand Theft Auto V,"GTAV is one of the greatest video game experiences that can only be experienced once. It is safe to say one of a game's requirements to be considered noteworthy is having replayability, but this really doesn't apply to GTAV just due to how amazing that first experience really was and how I really believe everyone has to beat this game at least once. "
Grand Theft Auto V,"Grand Theft Auto 5 is not my first Grand Theft Auto, but it's the first one I've completed.  I found the story to be very engaging, and the three characters all horrible people in their own way.  The driving is tight and fun, and I often found myself just stealing a car to go out on a drive, with no need to go on any specific missions.<br/><br/>The checkpointing system is pretty tolerant.  It keeps the difficulty curve for missions where it should be, but doesn't punish you too horribly when you mess up.  This keeps the momentum of the game moving forward in a way that previous installments of the game failed to do.<br/><br/>I love the colors and vibrancy of Los Santos, but felt at times that the depravity of this alternative California was played a little too over the top... almost to a Saints Row level.  At those times I felt a little taken out of the universe, but it was all in good fun.<br/><br/>All in all I had fun playing every single mission in the game, and even some of the side content.  I'd recommend going through the campaign without becoming too distracted by the sidequests in order to get the most enjoyment out of the game.  There's always plenty of time available after the campaign to destroy advertisements and get naughty pictures with the paparazzi."
Grand Theft Auto V,Great game love the story the graphics are outstanding and I thought the game looked good on the Xbox 360 and ps3 but wow even after all these years the game is still going strong.i thought that the 3 main character thing wouldn't have worked out that good but they managed to do it I got to say though I still prefer playing one character over multiple but that's good for this game because that's what makes it stick out over other massive titles as well.i love and hate some of the gameplay in my opinion Rockstar games could have done way better with the shooting mechanics like it works but It's bland compared to other AAA game that they made in the past for instance gta4 to rdr1 and max Payne 3 those title had very rememberable shooting after everyone is done with gta 5 nobody is going to look back on this game and say oh wow the shooting was awesome compared to other titles Rockstar has made.now on to the driving for me it's a yes it's very enjoyable.then on to the cops I feel like Rockstar could have gone better they should have took after gta 4 for this one the cops are way to brutal they just start shooting at you I have read articles about other players being arrested in this game but out of the 4 times I've played through the story I've never once had a cop not try to kill me and to sort of go back to the driving and shooting it feels like the cops are way to overpowered when driving I was testing out different cars and trucks to see which one is the easiest way to overpower the cops and for some reason cops can overpower a semi and I thought wow that is very unrealistic and I absolutely hate how they will go Infront of your car and just break check the heck out of you and when you try to find a different direction to get out of it they know exactly what your next move is very annoying and they are very hard to escape the best spot that I still find to be the best way to lose the cops is underneath the train tracks by the barber shop in Franklin area that he first starts and back to the shooting it might be just me but it absolutely bothers me how good of shots the AI is it seems like they came out of the movie wanted because they are very good at curving bullet and seem to have eagle eyes because they can shoot you with a pistol or shotgun from a mile away.and to continue with the story mode I like how the 3 main characters each have their own unique special like Michael has the slow motion shooting Franklin has the slow motion driving and Trevor has the rage mode very cool and they each have their own specific clothes and walk style the only thing that drives me crazy is how they all have the same fighting style I find that to be annoying and the fighting isn't that good either like it's predecessor gta 4 one of the best games for hand to hand fighting today in my opinion. And another thing that I wish they would have done with the story was in previous gta games the main character Always got paid after doing every mission this drove me crazy in gta v it made it feel very unopen world for a while we had the freedom to drive and walk around the map but for doing stuff there was not alot to do like for instance Franklin starts out with like 300 dollars what can you get in gtav with that That's like buying ammo and your done and Michael isn't any better he only starts out with I think 9800 dollars it just made the game feel really dead until your able to do the jewelry heist mission then it take you to Trevor why did we have to progress that much in the story just to unlock the tattoo shop?it's a very impressive story but a very boring world there is some activities such as golf tennis drinking and movie theater that only plays 2 boring movies like the first 2 times is like ok that was cool and then after that you really don't ever want to watch those again the one thing I was really hoping Rockstar would have done with the game was add some dlcs to it like extra missions and cars or clothes and please add more songs to the radio.And for the moment everyone likes to hear about is the online when it first came out it was a nightmare a bland world with absolutely nothing to do then later on Rockstar added some activities like parachuting and a couple of races wich at that time was the best way to make money was racing and still is today if your good at it I love and hate online today for this game I like the cars the clothes the tattoos the businesses the driving but the players do tend to keep me away most days now it was good when everyone was out to help everyone because they wanted to make money as well but then one day Rockstar decided to create a little thing call shark cards and then they outrageously increased the economy in the game now things started becoming more expensive and online missions and activities were starting not to hand out alot of money everything became and still is a grind then players decided to steal mom and dad's credit card and buy up all the shark card they could get and then now their bored and don't want to do the work and grind anymore so those players decided to start flying around on bikes and jets and helicopters and blow everything up all the time and make harder and unenjoyable for others who are and were still can't afford to buy shark cards there are private sessions but the thing that sucks is you can't do business missions without being in a public session so it made it very useless to have those in the game and if your going to keep the game going strong the least Rockstar could do is keep updating the radio stations and fix their servers and loading times and hopefully in next upcoming titles will add sessions for players who want to blowup and shoot each other all day and for players who want to make money and for players who can do all of that with specific friend in a private public session lobby great game with horrible online thank you for reading and I hope that this post is helpful for those who have not or have played this game.
Grand Theft Auto V,There's so much to do in this game it's insane. Truly a sandbox all-you-can-eat. Steven Ogg blows my mind.
Grand Theft Auto V,"I played this game for over five years now. I remember the good ol' days of me first playing this marvelous game, from learning how to fly a plane to getting obliterated by a rhino tank online. This game always comes back to me no matter how long I've stopped playing for.<br/> <br/>My rating 10/10"
Grand Theft Auto V,"Played this back in 2013. It was a good send-off for the past-gen consoles. For a little while, I felt rich playing it. The scope was overwhelming. But eventually, I worked my way through it, and by the end I felt kind of empty. The story was off-puttingly cynical and there's about 15 missions that, upon replaying it on my PS4, I realized were dogshit. I'll always admire the ambition, but I don't think it's the masterpiece others thought it was. "
Grand Theft Auto V,"I can see why people like this game. However, for me, the interesting things to do are too far and few between. A lot of effort was placed into detailing the game but the gameplay feels less polished. The online aspect is fun for a while, but even that sort of runs out of steam. <br/><br/>Just not for me. "
Grand Theft Auto V,"Pure shit. There are two good things in this game: Lamar and driving. Sadly, too much of the game is not that. Rockstar spends too much time trying to turn games into movies to realise that all the writing is shit. The reason I like Lamar isn't because I find him funny or cool, but because he doesn't feel like a fucking cartoon. Everyone else was completely flanderised before even being introduced to the player. The combat is boring, the jokes are kindergarten-esque, and Rockstar can't help but get the cum in your eyes."
Grand Theft Auto V,"After hundreds of hours played and real money spent i got ramdomly banned and they reset my character, i loose everything. Support team doesnt give a fuck. Never buy a Rockstar game again.

DONT BUY GTA 6 NEITHER!"
Grand Theft Auto V,"You could say that this game is acceptable, but I do not understand how people like it so much... I mean, it's great and everything ... but the story is not very good and it's not fun to do races, steals, etc. at all times!!!"
Grand Theft Auto V,ffdg

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Finished Game and DLC but not 100% (yet)<br/><br/>I tried to get into this a few times but just couldnt. Between the carry weight and the visual effect for your witcher sense i ended up giving up.. but my god am i glad i came back. Because there is no other game like the witcher out there. This game truly is a masterpiece to me. <br/><br/>Theres little else i can say that hasnt been said.<br/><br/>Combat- 10/10<br/>Not something i was used too.. or really interested in given most settings but because the story and world matched it so well, gave it a good reason.. it felt really compelling and masterfully done, i dont think i could have done any better. Even if i was just spinning my sword around like a tornado at the end lol.<br/><br/>Story- 10/10<br/>Now the main story's ending isnt the greatest, nothing insanely compelling but as i always say the journey to getting there is what counts. And every minute was a joy. The only quests i didnt like were the ones in skellige but i just didnt like the setting that much. Every character or quest feels important and meaningful. Theres the rare fetch quest but apart from that they are beautiful stories that our witcher fumbles his way through. <br/>The dlc are FUCKING INSANE. Every second of these masterpieces are mindblowing and these alone would get 10/10s from most people. <br/><br/>Gameplay- 10/10<br/>The gameplay never got boring or tedious, the weight being the biggest burden, it only ever got better and better. My favorite part was exploring a city and all its nooks and crannies though.. the forrests were less interesting for me.<br/><br/>Graphics/art- 10/10<br/>Looks fantastic, some really nice breathtaking views to be had and theres tons of attention to detail, from the monsters and darker stuff to just gwent cards they all look phenomenal.<br/><br/>Music- 10/10<br/>~<br/><br/><br/><br/>Overall Score - 10/10"
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"<div>Finished it on PC with a few mods added. I tried to get into this game 3 separate times. The first two was with the PS4 and after 8 hours in, I couldn't get into it. The battle mechanics felt clunky and the voice acting didn't really appeal to me. The two things that bothered me the most was the constant fixing of the swords and armors and the carry weight limit. I absolutely despised these factors.</div><div><br/></div><div>I gave it one more go when the upgraded graphics came out and this time, I played it on PC with mods that helped with the things I found annoying. And Holy Canoli, it made the game so much better. I adore games with strong storytelling and once I was able to remove the things that annoyed me, the Witcher world sucked me in. I got used to the Geralt's voice and the upgraded graphics made the game look so pretty to look at. <br/></div><div><br/></div><div>If I'm being honest, the the main storyline on Withcer 3 was like a 7/10 for me. It was cool, kept me engage most of the time. But the expansion pack, specifically Blood and Wine was at another level. That DLC really put the charm on the game. It felt like a really well done fantasy drama with a lot of the NPC really having depth in their characters. And I I enjoyed the fact that there were other accents used in this part of the world and it gave the Witcher world a fresher vibe.</div><div><br/></div><div>All in all, I rate this 8.5 / 10. Some tedious part here and there (running quests for x) but that's to be expected. If the side quests were created were it didn't feel so regurgitated, I would have given it a 10/10.<br/></div>"
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"A game that is flawless in every aspect except the combat, which is merely passable. One of the most beautiful games ever made with each area being a treat to the eyes, whether it's the swamps of Velen, the city of Novigrad, the islands of Skellige or the lush countryside of Toussaint. World building is top notch - I always enjoy reading the bestiary and journal entries of various characters you meet. The characters are all fantastic, Geralt, Ciri, Yennefer, Trish, etc. are instantly likable and interesting, and while Eredin might not be the best villain ever made, it is more than made up for with Gaunter o'Dimm and Detlaff van der Eretain in the two DLCs. The story is gripping from beginning to end and the side quests are equally fantastic as well. Music is also great, especially in the Skellige region. Role play aspect is also done very well, I rarely if ever felt like my dialogue options were meaningless. Gwent is also quite addicting. <br/><br/>Again, combat could be better and there are quite a lot of bugs but otherwise it's an absolute must-buy and is a game that sets the standards for RPGs everywhere. "
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,One of the best games I’ve ever played the soundtrack the story the world building all amazing 
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Time: 205h<br/>205 hours later, finally beat it! Played through both Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine as well as what had to be every side quest in the base storyline. 

The main story was great, but I have to agree with what a lot of people thought, which was that the Blood and Wine expansion was just as good if not better than the main story. Toussaint and the many additions (grandmaster armor, mutagens, Corvo Bianco, etc.) all played into a fantastic ending to the Witcher 3. On my playthrough, I think I got the best ending: saving Syanna, killing Dettlaff, and despite Regis being exiled, Geralt and him part amicably which I liked. The ending was a nice cap to the main story.

Hearts of Stone was good as well - Ogeird was a character, and Gaunter O’Grimm certainly made things interesting.

Enjoyed all the different areas, Skellige and Toussaint being my favorite (except for the fact that so many points of interest in Skellige were in the water and required a boat). 

There were certainly parts towards the end where I was tired of continuing to play...but I’m glad I finished it. One of the best games I’ve played, and certainly managed to keep my attention for many, many hours. "
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The Witcher 3 is by far my favorite game I've ever played.  There are no words that accurately describe the feeling this game gives you when you play it for the first time.  The multiple astounding themes this game presents from politics to family, from war to love, and from loyalty to differing beliefs, they all make The Witcher 3 feel grounded in reality while still being a fantasy game.  What makes this game so great is its astounding writing.  Every quest you do, every character you encounter, every monster you fight, feels real in the sense that the characters and stories are never two dimensional.  Every character has a story to tell, and the characters will present you with tough decisions that will make you question your morals.  Another thing that makes this game so exceptional is its characters, specifically the main cast.  Every character in this game is fleshed out with hours of content that make you care about them.  Every character has their own identity and personality that makes for some of the best chemistry between characters a game has ever seen.  From Geralt's charisma to Yennefer's sarcasm from Zoltan's wit to Vezemir's wisdom, all make for a memorable cast that people can invest and sympathize with on a deeper level.  Now it might sound like I am praising this game to no end, but I would like to state that before going into the game, I had a very closed mind.  From what I saw through videos and from what I heard from friends, I thought the game was going to be too hardcore and another generic unrealistic fantasy game with no relatability to the player.  So this game had to fight against an (unfair) negative bias I had and still managed to not only surpass my low expectations but it managed to climb the ranks of my favorite games.  Genuinely, the only thing I didn't like about the game was after I beat all the main content and DLC, I felt a void because the story and characters I got invested in had to come to an end. All in all, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes a really good singleplayer story game.            "
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Oh boy oh boy. How long has it been since the Witcher 3 has been released. Trust me when I say this but the Witcher 3 is one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life, and that’s something to say.<br/><br/>Now I’m not gonna talk a lot about the game since it has been released for 5 years already, but all I’m going to say is this game is a must buy!!! With an amazing story, and an enticing and awesome rpg system, you just can’t say no to this game. This game is really amazing, how you can craft potions and at which fight you use them really adds to the experience. Before you go in to a fight, you have to be fully prepared by doing quests and what not, all of them really amazing and with great variety, never boring! Honestly, I think this game is a must have for Gamers, it is probably one of the best games this decade, and really revolutionized RPG games."
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"One of the best realized fictional settings ever. Absolutely worth the price of admission if you're into worldbuilding at all. Oh, and that's just one aspect of a beautiful, multifaceted game with so many positives it's impossible to list. "
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Simply outstanding.<br/>Comparing with Skyrim, the Elder Scroll, this game is an upgrade in many aspects. Beautiful graphics, catching story, versatile open world, cutting-edge AI and plethora of friends/foes/missions. I absolutely loved every minute of game play. Because of brutal violence, sexual references, profanity, etc. not at all recommended for people below 18, and I'm serious here. Once you finish the game, you really feel an emptiness and wish that there was more. For those really craving, you must try the expansion pack Blood and Wine.

"
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,One of the best RPG's I've ever played. Even side quest felt like they had some kind of purpose. 
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"story is fun, characters are fun, combat is shallow. last thing i did before uninstalling was stunlock a griffin by left-clicking over and over for about 2 minutes until it finally died. i may come back one day and try this again with mods"
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"after 4 long years i’ve finally finished the main story. no matter how much I love breath of the wild, it’s impossible to act like this game isn’t the best game ever made. and I got the good ending! can’t wait for cyberpunk 2077. "
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,A very spectacular game love the story and still a very amazing looking game great graphics the characters are Very rememberable this is going to irritate the hardcore fans but I didn't really care for the fighting I like more of the Skyrim or batman/sleeping dogs fighting is preferred for me but I will say that the blood and gore looked very amazing I liked the open world I just found annoying at times when you want to have a look around the world it seems that there is always a creature getting in the but besides that love the game if you haven't yet I would suggest that you go watch the new Witcher series on Netflix and play this game it is totally worth it.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The Witcher 3 is my favourite rpg of all time and is right at the top of the list for favourite game of this generation.<br/><br/>It takes a bit of time to get into because there are a lot of systems you need to understand, and it takes a bit of time to fully appreciate the world they have created. Once I got there it was absolutely fantastic. The rpg upgrade mechanisms are unique and well done. The equipment customization and enhancements are plentiful when you fully utilize potions and oils etc. But when it comes down to a single greatest feat it is the world building. The detail in this game is incredible. I’ve never had so much fun in a fantasy setting.<br/><br/>Final Score: A++"
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"This game is overrated! Is probably what your thoughts will be as a person who straight jumped into the 3rd witcher game,  it’s a massive game, and your opinion about it would count after  at least 30 hours which is almost the time to play a new game, those who feel overwhelmed by it and found it tedious will probably not wait for ~30 hours to decide. Which is unfortunate, as its only after about 30 hours that this game progresses from something that is tedious/slow/overwhelming to come show itself to be one of the most polished deep video games that's been made to date. And when I say deep I don’t meant it to be very abstract in its writing, or bombarding the player with themes and theories that they couldn’t have up with, in fact there is nothing very deep or unexpected in it. What it has however is a sense of scale that is unsurpassed in any video game I've ever played.
<br/>The Witcher 3 continues the story of Geralt of Rivia, a known monster slayer aka Witcher who …you guessed it ..kills monster!  After the events of the Witcher 1 &amp;amp; 2 Geralt has restored his memory and now he is searching for his former partner Yennefer of Vengerberg, Geralt with Yennefer have to look for Ciri who is constantly on run and is being chased by the ""Wild Hunt"" <br/>The story  starts slow as Geralt wants to find Ciri his adopted daughter,  the game just like its prequels consists of prologue, acts, epilogue, the prologue starts with a tutorial area  called White Orchard which teaches the player about the game and introduces them to its basics, it is this part that is slow and tedious because the game didn’t kick in yet, the game continues with act 1 main goal which is to find Ciri, the story may seem very simple as you have to look for a character but inside the journey Geralt will meet very complex characters and the main quests start going branching paths to side quests who are among the greatest side quests ever written in gaming. The game continues with ACT 2 and takes into the epic battle genre this time, in this act the game has lord of the rings vibes, an epic battle,  which then continues on its epic scale into ACT 3, until the epilogue which can vary depending on the player decisions in the game. No matter what ending the player gets it always has something great and emotional behind it.<br/>The story doesn’t end there, after the main game CD project RED introduces an expansion (Hearts of Stone) which is a short story  expansion that blew my mind at how smartly written and engaging it is, the expansions introduces one of the most cunning and mysterious villains in history of gaming, and  another equally amazing character. Unlike the main game in terms of side quests the quantity is very low, as the main focus here was to tell the short story in the main quest. The expansion also added some of the best boss fights in the whole series, boss fights that were a huge step up from the main game, requiring more mechanics to beat and having more advanced pattern.<br/>The story progresses afterwards to reach the second expansion (Blood and Wine) which marks the end of Geralt journey, in my opinion an expansion one of its kind, very huge area that is also very beautiful, contains some of my favorite characters in the series, the expansion starts as a murder mystery then progresses into something fairytale-like that is full of neat references to famous books and finishes with one of the most memorable boss fights I have ever had in gaming.
<br/><br/>It has to be noticed I have not mentioned the other aspects of the game, which I will cover in short.
The Gameplay itself is very good, and while the combat and controls may feel clunky at first it won't take much time to get used to them, which afterwards Geralt feels like a dancing swordsman which is what he really is (according to the books and the lore). The combat itself is fairly basic and limited (again because of the lore) and contains light/heavy attack and dodge(side-step)/Roll buttons as well as having signs (mini-magic) it has similarities to Batman combat system, however I find the combat to start getting more advanced and having more depth once the players starts going with alchemy (bombs-oils-decoctions-potions) which basically adds new abilities to the gameplay, on higher difficulties the player needs to take advantage of monsters, read about their weakness and use the Witcher tools to overcome the challenge, the gameplay progresses by increasing levels and unlocking more skills to make various builds and especially around the second expansions it adds another layer to it by adding something called mutations. There are a lot of monsters and each has interesting ideas and design behind them. The dialogue choices are impactful and then there is one of my favorite mini games ever made called Gwent, a tactical card game that is really enjoyable, I sunk many hours into it while  forgetting about the quests that im doing.
<br/><br/>The Music is Slavic inspired and feels folklorish, its simple music most of the time, not an orchestra type of music, its simple and has as Geralt says ""Nice Tune""  it contains many memorable soundtracks.
<br/>The voice acting is greatly done as well, there is a difference in accents between regions which strongly showcase the different cultures the game tries to portray.  
<br/><br/>The art direction is simply breathtaking, the game is very screenshot worthy, to understand this point simply go to any thread on the internet and check for Witcher 3 shots, preferably on PC high settings and the amount of details and beautiful art design is mindblowing. It looks amazing.
<br/><br/>The character cast is among my favorite, they have great distinct personalities, they have good development and backstory counting the previous games as well, some of the most complex and well written characters in gaming are presented in Witcher series, memorable cast with beautiful design and nice personality. You may notice most characters are not really good and not really bad, its shades of gray as in Witcher world there is no absolute evil or good.
<br/><br/>Overall the game is open world story driven rpg, the main draw behind the game is its worldbuilding and writing which has main &amp;amp; side quests and characters. The game has the other good aspects as well, but if you are into open world story driven rpg games I cannot recommend this one enough, it is a must play game and is truly among the greatest games of all time, its recommended that you at least be familiar with the prequels Witcher 1 and Witcher 2 at least, to further understand the story better and enhance your experience and immersion. 
Thank you for Reading!

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"If you did not play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt yet, PLAY IT, the game is just amazing...<br/>Music, graphics, story, fighting mechanics, it's just incredible.<br/>Congrats CD Projekt Red and thanks for making this game one of my favorites."
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"tl;dr An absolute masterpiece and a genre defining game. |.|<br/><br/><br/>I can't sing this game enough praises. This game will absolutely suck you in from the first minute until you finally finish Geralt's quest. The storytelling (Yes, I know it's based on a novel) is top notch, the world design is phenomenal, the music is near orgasmic, and the characters will pull you in and make you feel that you are indeed a witcher. If this game has somehow slipped under your radar, do yourself a favor and pick it up. CD Projekt Red has released an absolute must play gem.<br/><br/><br/>This is one of very few games I would ever consider giving this score but, 10/10 this game is (as stated above) an absolute masterpiece."
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,Sooooooooooooo... I'm right now playing The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. For the third time! And my plan is to complete it 100%! For the third time! 'Nuff said.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Remember the ""diving"" stuff in Sci-Fi futuristic media where you'd virtually go into a different world? This is the current-gen equivalent of that. A beautiful open living world that never kicks you out of your immersion and keeps calling you back long after you've completed the masterfully-told story. Insane attention to detail, crazy polish, characters from integral ones to NPCs that actually don't remind you they are scripted, hundreds of unique side quests, much more, and a weird horse."
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"If any of the people leaving positive reviews on Monster Hunter World had played this, they wouldn't be leaving positive reviews on Monster Hunter World."
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I have way more than 100 hours in it on my PS4 and I started replaying it on PC too, What can I say? This really is a GOTY, and CDPR deserves all the support and praise it got for it. Truly a masterpiece."
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"The best adventure I've seen in my entire life – not only in games, but also in books, in movies, anywhere!  This is why games are the future of story-telling. 
I strongly believe that every developer has to play The Witcher 3 before starting his own game. Not to understand that you can't do nothing even close to this masterpiece, but to see that amazing, out of the box games can be done without following stupid modern trends and still be praised and profitable. This game redefined the cRPG genre and I can't wait for CDPR to drop Cyberpunk 2077.
"
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I have played dozens of games over the last few years, and I doubt that anything can even compare with Witcher 3. From the visuals to the lore to the gameplay mechanics to the story – this is one the best piece of art humanity ever produced. 
CDPR are the masters of RPGs and they definitely raised the bar in gamedev that no one could reach up to this day. This game is worth any money it is sold for, trust me, it so good you'll want two copies.
"
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"I invested many hours into it, on the console, on the PC, the game is great anywhere. It's worth a single cent even when it is sold for the full price. There are so many content and non-linearity and choices are so compelling that it is easy to replay it for four or five times, which will make up for a decade if you have a job and a social life. <br/><br/>Waiting for the game of the decade edition!

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,This is the epitome of how games should be made. The Witcher drove me back home after a long day at work for a year. It brought tears to my eyes. It made me laugh. It made me angry. It made me happy. It made me fall in love with gaming all over again. 
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,I want to have local amnesia and forget half-year of my life spent in Witcher 3. Just to play this game again.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,EPIC adventure - MUST-HAVE RPG game - and don't forget to get DLCs which are like additional games in length.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"Stellar. Greater than the sum of its parts, and a beautiful experience"
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, 7.8/10.0

If you are reasonably good you can make the Game in 6-10 Hours. I have not Noticed any mistakes-from me a clear KAUFEMPFEHLING"
Portal 2,"+ Innovative Game Mechanics and Story portal 2 is a Declaration of Love for Science. The Game tries to help humanity, or Aperture Science, break through on several multidimensional Meta-levels by continuously testing. After intensive Research in the worldwide Computer network system [<a href=""http://de.valve.wikia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">de.valve.wikia.com</a>], the Trainee who authored this Text found the following three Meta-levels to be particularly noteworthy: Meta-level: The ""Secret Konter Manoeuvre""-A safe Technique for the Life-saving ""Heimlich Maneuvers.""

+ Coop mode and Workshop The Coop mode brings Fun for two, the Workshop brings a lot of Content.
Verdict: 10/10 Genius Game. Hopefully a third Part will come soon."
Portal 2,"Arguably one of the greatest puzzle games ever created, and Valve's magnum opus. Portal 2 did what seemed impossible: it took Portal, a four-hour little curio made as an added-extra for The Orange Box, and turned it into a fully fleshed out campaign that added new elements, new characters, and a superb co-op mode without sacrificing any of the charm, puzzles, or comedy of the original. "
Portal 2,"Amazing, top 5 best games ever played. Played back in 2017 and was a blast figuring out the puzzles"
Portal 2,"When they transfer my consciousness into a stadium-sized supercomputer, the vast flow of information will drive me insane. (c) Cave Johnson<br/><br/>The program that drives everyone mad. By this fact we can realize that any module will be poisoned by it. That's what happened to Wheatley. This is a nice story with a blurred notion of morality. Someone must to control this system and the only one, as it turns out, is GLaDOS."
Portal 2,"Hours of fun in co op, more fun playing single player, better than the first, a genuine story now"
Portal 2,"Still one of, if not the, funniest games ever made, moreso than the first game. Probably held up by its humor more than its learning curve, unlike the first game. The whole Caroline subplot is a bit unnecessary and the middle part can turn into a bit of a ""find the white wall"" hunt, but it all comes together well in the end in frankly one of the better final boss fights I've played."
Portal 2,"Honestly, the best co op game of all time. Oh, also there's a pretty darn good singleplayer story in there, too."
Portal 2,"+++<br/>If you care at all about Game Design as an art form for any reason and want to learn about player guidance, conveyance of information, sound design or environmental clues, this game is one that absolutely MUST be studied.<br/>+++<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest Valve fan out there. I have an immense amount of respect for the company, especially if we're talking about the time frame of Portal 2's release and the impact the Half-Life franchise, the Source Engine and Steam have had is in no way lost on me, but their flagship titles have always been a mixed bag for me.<br/>I think Half-Life is cool and its sequel was super interesting and technically impressive at the time, but the world-building, atmosphere and just general minute-to-minute gameplay never really gripped me in the way it has gripped others.<br/>Due to their shorter length, I actually preferred Episode 1 and especially Episode 2, but I never really cared all that much about any of the Half-Life games, personally, and saw myself more as a distant admirer of what they have achieved, though I still say, to this day, that the Source Engine is one of the best-feeling engines ever.<br/><br/>So, naturally, while I was blown away by the value of it, I didn't really care that much about the Orange Box when that was announced, and chances are I wouldn't have given it a go anytime close to launch if it wasn't for that weird little extra game shown as a little pack-in bonus: Portal.<br/><br/>The trailers were incredibly intriguing at the time. The cold, sterile environments, the mind-boggling gimmick of the Portal Gun and the unique flavor of humor they presented players with made it impossible for me not to look forward to the Orange Box.<br/>Everyone was hyped for Episode 2, some really cared about Team Fortress 2, and Portal was seen by most as just this extra little curiosity. Almost like some kind of tech demo or something. But for me it was the other way around.<br/><br/>And then came release day, and I played through Portal in a single sitting, and would just sit there afterwards for at least 10 minutes, with a huge grin on my face and slightly teary-eyed, in awe of the amazing ride I had just experienced.<br/>This game, while incredibly short, was something truly special and struck a really good balance of demanding conundrums and the kind of silly humor that feels like it's melting away your brain. All of it presented mostly in a very chill, take-your-time kind of manner but interspersed with a few highlight scenes that are quite intense in comparison.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the experience stuck with me for a while, and not just because of the memes the game spawned.<br/><br/>So when the sequel was announced, as a full-price standalone title, the hype was overwhelming. I was aware how much I was setting myself up for disappointment. Portal was lightning in a bottle and kind of had the perfect length, ending pretty much right before it would start to overstay its welcome. And it was something unforgettable and special, yet not something I would've deemed worth more than maybe 20€ to most people.<br/>So how could Portal 2 possibly NOT disappoint? How could it possibly more than a retread or a paid expansion or something?<br/><br/>But still, the hype grew bigger and bigger with every month, week and day the release grew closer. Every new trailer and gameplay video they showed, I was giddy with excitement and bracing for the whiplash once the almost inevitable disappointment would kick in.<br/><br/>But ooh boy... as you can probably tell by the rating I gave this game, and the tone of this review so far, it somehow managed to exceed my incredibly high expectations.<br/><br/><br/>Portal 2 definitely IS more Portal, but at a far greater scale in any way. It constantly expands the scope of the basic Portal puzzles and adds so many new gimmicks and tools that the portals themselves begin to feel secondary, instead of the main focus, even though they are constantly being used. They simply start feeling like, say, Mario's Jump, in that it is integral to the gameplay, but kind of ""is just there"" as a natural part of your move set while the many other gimmicks demand the player's attention.<br/><br/>The environments have also been expanded greatly. The game still takes place in the same research facility of the original game, but the player is no longer restricted to a few simple, mostly white rooms and instead gets a literal look behind the scenes, as well as to what happened to this facility in the long, undisclosed amount of time since its abandonment.<br/><br/>Portal 1's ""story"" and writing was carried mostly by the evil, sarcastic AI GLaDOS and supported by some more-or-less hidden environmental story telling left behind by a previous test subject.<br/>There is so much more of both of these in Portal 2, with GLaDOS becoming way more of a developed character than she was in the original, but even her brilliance is now rivaled by newcomer Wheatley, a little, spherical, British robot who both guides and hinders the player throughout the adventure.<br/>I don't wanna give anything away, just at the off chance that someone who hasn't played the game is reading this, but there are a lot of hilarious, and awesome in the original sense of the word, twists and turns this game's story takes that makes Portal 1 almost feel boring in comparison.<br/><br/>In this way Portal 2 takes everything people loved about the original and expands it in just about any conceivable way.<br/>And to top it off, there is a whole separate Co-Op campaign with its own unique dialog (well, monologue really) and its own brilliant level design.<br/>And some time after the game has been out, Valve even released a pretty easy to use and publish Level Creator tool which gives the game almost endless content.<br/><br/><br/>What really impressed me about the game above all else though is how polished and well-designed it is. There are so many subtle audio-visual clues about solutions that, without feeling hand-holdy, always seem to get you to the right solution of a puzzle eventually, no matter how absolutely stumped you might feel at the outset.<br/>When you first play the game, you probably won't really notice, or quickly drone out, many of the noises given off of the different things found in a level that inform and remind you of the state and location of them in subtle ways, even when you are not actively looking at them. This helps immensely in giving the player a complex image of any level and puzzle in their head and gently guides them towards the right path.<br/><br/>The pacing, too, is amazing, which kept me from either getting exhausted and puzzled-out or bored, even though I played the game pretty much in one setting with only a few short breaks in-between. And I was laughing the whole way through, though the game does get pretty intense and mellow at times, especially if you do pay attention to every little thing.<br/><br/>This game is simply a masterpiece that I lack the competency to properly do justice. If it seems AT ALL appealing to you, you absolutely owe yourself to play through it at least once. And at this point, especially during special sales, the game is dirt cheap and should run on pretty much any machine bought in the last decade-or-so, so you really don't have an excuse not to play it.<br/>And if you have, hecc, go play it again!"
Portal 2,"Portal 2 is an amazing game:  the core puzzles are perfectly executed (if a bit easy), the humor is good enough that most of the jokes land even on the second (or later) playthrough, the storyline is very engaging, the characters are extremely well-written, the voice acting is better than many movies that saw a theatrical release, the world-building is amazing, and just playing around with a portal gun gives the players so much flexibility in how to confront each level that the game feels open-ended in spite of having a tightly crafted linear story.  <br/><br/>Haven't played the co-op in years so I can't comment on that aspect but the fact that you can get this game on sale for under $5 is insane given the quality.  Did I mention that the gameplay decision decisions and graphics feel like something an AAA might still release today even though the game came out years ago?  <br/><br/>Recommended more than even this laudatory review suggests, just get it already!"
Portal 2,"A breathtaking combination of puzzle and story. Beautiful humor and dialogue, memorable characters and mesmerizing atmosphere. Fantastic co-op mode that truly encourages interactions between players, unlike many other ""co-op"" games.<br/><br/>The only negative side of the game for me is that I felt like my actions as a player never really were the source of the other characters' change. But that is just my little preference."
Portal 2,"Play the first Portal game before playing this, as the story picks up right after the first one. The game is littered with references to the first game, which while aren't necessary to enjoy the game really enhance the writing and story."
Portal 2,"The only shame here is that Valve is deathly afraid of the number 3.<br/><br/>Never have I wished for a sequel more than after finishing this.<br/><br/>The ""Perpetual Testing Initiative"" is cool and all....but it's not enough Portal to last us the rest of our species's existence."

Tomb Raider (2013),"On the first Start of the Game I thought to myself, ""What did I buy for garbage?."" 
Well, the Game runs in the DOSBox emulator, which wouldn't be bad if it worked. At the first Start, only a flickering Picture came to me as one might still know it from VHS times. The Pressure on the Windows button and The setting of the monitor resolution in the Emulator provided a Remedy. Movie Scenes have unfortunately pulled through distinct black Scanlines horizontally, which rather clouds the Quality. During the Game, however, the Quality is great. Graphically settled down, of course, but which is no Reason to judge it badly was just like that at the Time. The Control takes getting used to, the Mouse is not needed here. It is Controlled by the Arrow keys. The Action Button is Strg on the left, which is used to climb, with the Space key the Miss gets the Creaks out. I haven't played it for long, but you can walk through the Corridors and first explore everything that I personally like. You don't have to aim for yourself, you can do that automatically, but what is understandable with the Control and probably wouldn't be possible otherwise. Since I bought the Game in the Sale for 1.50 I want to look past these little Mistakes. What you shouldn't do is go to the Desktop during the Game, otherwise the Image will disappear in the Emulator and you have to restart the Game. But it could have been said that the Game is running in the Emulator. Still interesting. 
MFG mheetu"
Tomb Raider (2013),"Classical review ""Tomb Raider I,"" the Beginning of a legendary Series.
Is it still something Innovative to say about this Game? Lara Croft puzzles, jumps and shoots your way through imaginative Ruins of Caves and Pyramids. So far, so well known.
For me, the biggest Plus: Level Design. Hardly any other Game has created such intelligent and varied Levels, despite quite few Possibilities, considering the Hardware Performance of the Time.
What (especially young) Players should know:-the Port is in need of getting used to, the Resolution for today'S Standards very ancient. The Game runs best in the Window, but there are also port-related, very unsightly Graphic Rucklers.
-the Control is no longer up-to-date and difficult to prove anew. Lara controls herself primarily by Keyboard and, despite her graceful Physique, uses so-called tank controls. But If you get used to it, the Control works well and precisely.
-the Jumping Behavior Is strange for today'S games. Often Lara has to sneak up to an Edge, take a Step back and only then can you be sure the Jump Distance is right. This System may seem cumbersome, but it is very precise in itself.
Despite these Points-it is a rather old Game: ""Tomb Raider I"" should have been drawn by anyone who is interested in Games. It is certainly a Milestone in the History of The game and is also a lot of Fun. The long Playing Time and pleasantly crisp difficulty make ""Tomb Raider I"" One of the best oldie games of all Time."
Tomb Raider (2013),"I honestly liked Tomb Raider more than I thought it would. I came in here expecting a poor man's Uncharted clone. After finishing the game I am left with wanting more. It is very similar to the Uncharted games, albeit it does do unique things to distinguish itself from the former. Most notably the somewhat more open level design. It is still very linear but you are sometimes faced with larger ""hub-like"" areas and optional tombs (which are just a single puzzle) which are largely missing from the Uncharted games.<br/><br/>Let's move away from the Uncharted comparisons and speak on what the game does. Gameplay is split between traversal and combat. For traversal, all you do is wander down often linear paths with minor platforming challenges and easy puzzles. Combat has two approaches, stealth and guns blazing. Both of these styles of combat are marred by very poor AI. AI are often comically oblivious in stealth and during a gunfight, enemies will often exit cover and walk in a straight line towards your position. Gun-play is also nothing to write home about and stealth is way too shallow to even bother with. Even with all these complaints, I still enjoyed my time during battles. They were like junk food, fun but nothing special.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this is an apt comparison, but the story gave me heavy Indiana Jones vibes which I like a lot. The story was an enjoyable action filled romp. Although the beginning of the game makes you expect something more gritty but then turns into something more akin to Uncharted (I'm sorry for bringing it up again). I'm not very good at critiquing narratives as I am easily pleased, so I will leave off saying that I simply enjoyed the story.<br/><br/>Lastly, my technical experience was fairly good. The game ran amazingly but had issues with the UI. Certain UI elements that flashed on screen when going near an interactable or trying to grab ammo that you are full on are cut off at the top left of the screen. Thankfully nothing essential was cut off but it was still annoying nonetheless. Also, voice audio and sound fx audio were combined in settings for some reason. Music was not thankfully, but sometimes sound fx drowned out dialogue which is somewhat remedied by subtitles. Other than those issues, the game ran extremely well with no noticeable frame drops or crashes.<br/><br/>tl;dr
Tomb Raider is definitely worth playing because of its fun narrative and enjoyable albeit easy gameplay."
Tomb Raider (2013),"Given that the game is about a decade old now, the graphics, effects, sound mechanics, and overall gameplay are simply stunning. The cinematics and cut scenes are great, the story isn't terrible either. However I expected more challenging ending."
Tomb Raider (2013),"I love this Lara Croft, excited to see whats next for her after the trilogy (hopefully duel wielding)"
Tomb Raider (2013),"This is probably my favorite game from the new trilogy, I absolutely loved the mechanics, the feeling of the game, but the spotlight goes to this version of Lara Croft who we watch grow as a character, from an explorer to a survivor, doing whatever she needs to do. "
Tomb Raider (2013),"I'd wanted this game for a really long time. I'd play the demo for the sequel and loved climbing and using a bow and arrow and solving puzzles connected to ancient relics. I loved the idea of an Uncharted style game where it was just about crawling and climbing around catacombs and caves and just the general raiding of tombs. I was excited to play a game where the action was the backseat to the adventure and exploration in a modern setting. However, I realized immediately that this wasn't going to be that game and I was fine with that. I was actually interested in the idea of a survival game with tomb raiding where you'd have to hunt and live off the island until you could get rescued. And I enjoyed it right up until you pick up a gun and then the game becomes a full out shooter. It's just basically constant explosions and such a streamlined nature to the gameplay that makes it feel like the camera is pushing you forcibly down a path of gunfire with invisible bumpers leading to the next chapter of the mediocre storyline with the facade of an open world. Such a disappointing game. I want a game like this without mass murder, it's such a chore to get through and the tomb raiding is essentially entirely optional. "
Tomb Raider (2013),I’ve voiced my opinion on this series. I thinks it’s fine but nothing better than fine. I think this is the weakest of the series. I just didn’t enjoy my time with it that much.<br/><br/>Final Score: B
Tomb Raider (2013),Great story great graphics great  I've been a   fan of the tomb raider series for years I really like the story of Lara I like the location but I thought the shooting physics were to touchy for my taste but overall a great game.
Tomb Raider (2013),Not my cup of tea but not a bad game by any means. I was able to get about an hour and a half of genuine enjoyment before putting it down. You can get it on sale on Steam super cheap so it won't hurt to try it out if you haven't. 
Tomb Raider (2013),"5 years or so ago some kind of fashion in video game industry to reboot started. Reboot
everything! So now we have new games which are proudly called “Doom”, “Thief” or “Hitman”.
Released in 2013 “Tomb Raider” was no exception. What we got back then was something
special indeed. Lara Croft for the first time is not only just a sex subject but rather human who
feels, is emotional (and have small boobs and realistic legs!). This game is about all the first
times. First time to get injured, first time to be almost killed and first time to actually kill a
human being. It’s all very dramatic and the things which player sees and hears especially in the
beginning of game actually forces to empathize with the protagonist. It’s quite rare to be
emotionally invested in the main character in the video game and Tomb Raider delivers it to its
fullest."

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,"Have you always Wanted to beat yourself verbally with strangers? Have you always Wanted to know how many 12 Year olds have driven it with your Mother? 
Welcome to CS: GO! 
Here you will learn Russian Within a few Weeks and can make the Top 100 Insults in any Language. Within a few Games you can find more Insults in Russian than in your Native Language. Anyone who thinks they are tearing something in this Game is very wrong. Conflicts are solved by Team kills and if that is not enough, another ""Nazi, ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥"" comes behind. If one is Lagging behind in the first Quarter of the MM, the first Team mate will leave the Game.
Ok, now seriously.
With almost 1000h Of Game time, I've already experienced quite a bit in this Game and some Experience of how a Standard Matchmaking works.
Teams: When the last funny Being presses ""Accept"" At the last Second, the Teams are chosen. These usually look like this: 1. You 2nd Russian 1 3rd Russian 2 4th Russian 3 5. Russian Spouse Once then a ""Cy * a"" Said in voice chat, if it is used at all, you already know ""another fu * king russian in our team ..."" Since this is a Team-based game, Eastern Europeans naturally recognize that English is a No-Go. So you can then disable the Voice Chat. With a bit of Luck you also have a competent Player in the Team, but otherwise it says: Keep Dictionary ready.
Gameplay: Since the Game is very realistic, (I am also in Afghanistan and die due to a Decoy, easy!), of course, the Gameplay must also be built up accordingly. While the RPG is not available as a Weapon, any other Weapon takes over this Job with Flying colours. If you stand behind your Opponent and shoot your whole Magazine because not a single Shot hit and then moved a Millimeter, it greets you with a 180 ° MLG rotation that he still performs in the Jump. What happens? You get into the Fresco that you simply chill in the Corner and if necessary your Keyboard, mouse, Headset or even your Monitor Breaks. Then there is the AWP. If you can handle this Weapon, the deadliest weapon you can hold in your Hand. However, hardly anyone can do it and yet everyone gets this Weapon. Why? To then lose them again because not a single Shot hit.
Rank System: Anyone who thinks that thanks to the Rank system, you only play with equal times, you're very wrong here, too. Because many Weeks after a CS: GO sale, it's just teeming with Hackers and I don't even want to talk about Smurfs.
Then comes this Prime Matchmaking, a pointless button that fulfills its functions here as well ...
Skins: Skins are the Key to Success. If you think you're better with Embellishments, you can walk right through the Door and play Call of Duty. If you don't have Skins you are poor, a Hacker or a Smurf. If you have Skins, you are a 12 Year old Lucky child who has made €500 through 3 Boxes and thus indicates like a Victim. If you have a Knife you are the King Of the pile of Dust. To purchase Skins, there are two Options here again: 1. Buy the few Pixels for incredible Sums via the Market 2. Buy you Key, FOR 2.30€ OR MORE, and open Boxes where in 80% of Cases there is a Profit of-98%.
3. Use your Parents ' Credit card-they will rejoice.
Verdict: If you play the Game to have Fun, you can't go wrong with anything here. But Whoever also plays to win in The Competition should look for a full Lobby with Friends before playing before starting the Game.
If you don't have a lust and want to play at a higher Level then sign up for ESEA or FaceIt. A good alternative to avoid the Hackers (ACHTING! Also play there Professionals who have it, yes ... Really can ...)
Always Remember: CS: GO is like Roulette, funny until it gets Russian."
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the definition of a proper first person shooter. Easy to learn, practically impossible to master. The closest anyone has ever come to mastering the game is Astralis &amp; even then they could not win every single competition, only the majors. When I want to play a great shooter, I don't think twice, I just open CS:GO, it's that simple. This franchise made the AWP a household name &amp; for good reason. The only thing this game is missing is the Arctic Avengers &amp; Crackhouse on official servers."
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,"This game is a reinvention of the idea of «Counter-Strike».<br/><br/>I can understand why old «CS 1.6» fans might not like it. «CS GO» is made for a completely different audience and mostly for the younger generation.<br/><br/>It's not as minimalistic as «1.6», but it has a lot more logic and variety. More than 9 game modes that are completely different. Also the game itself is more fun.<br/><br/>I personally like the appearance of logic and some sort of game lore. Each map has its own set of factions of terrorists and counter-terrorists, which corresponds to location or country in which the operation. It's very immersive."
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,"I'm not a fan of multiplayer FPS in general, but I've had fun playing single-player FPS's earlier so I thought this FTP multiplayer FPS would be a good place to start to expand my horizon.  I was surprised to find myself in the minority in that I not only didn't get addicted to this game but found it boring enough that I uninstalled after a few hours of play.<br/><br/>I appreciate that it's probably just disinterest in the genre rather than any issue with the game itself that is driving that, but I found most of the game modes to be relatively interchangeable.  Reading up on online strategy, it seems like there's a bit of player psychology to work out but most of the rest of the skill-building that takes place is just improving the same set of skill mechanics over a large number of games.  Again, I get that this is just an aesthetic thing on my end, but there doesn't seem to be as much variety in gameplay as there is in the battle royale genre, the open-world survival games, or in some of the class-based battle or shooting games.  There's no world-building, storyline, and even the aesthetics of the battle areas don't really have anything to do with gameplay.  The music is completely forgettable, and the graphics are fine but no longer anything unprecedented for a multiplayer game of this scope.<br/><br/>It's free-to-play so I wouldn't have any objections to someone trying it, but overall I had trouble getting a sense of what the fuss was about.  (That has not been true for me historically for Valve F2P multiplayer games, since I ended up putting like 100 hours into Dota my first month of playing).  That said, I really did not get the appeal at all, so I can't say that I recommend it."
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,"Counter strike. Many gamers know this name, it was a game that had once conquered the twitch page along with Dota 2. <br/><br/>Now I may not list counter strike as an exceptional game, but it doesn’t mean you should play it, especially now that it’s free. The only reason I wouldn’t recommended playing this game, is because of the toxicity and hackers in the game. It is literally crazy and I doubt a new player would actually survive playing it now in 2020. But anyways into the good stuff. The game is actually really fun and very tactical, especially with friends. It actually has a very intriguing shooting system, on how every gun has its own unique shooting pattern. And it also isn’t your typical cod where you can slide and get kills, oh no, it’s much more challenging. In order for you to get as little bullet spread as possible you are going to have to actually crouch while shooting. Wired right, well in a sense yeah... but this is what makes the game so beautiful. If you look at esports for example, most of them have to actually work in teams, in order to either defend the bombs as terrorists, or defuse it as counter terrorists. This is where many tactical plays come in, and the game is also very aim reliant. If you miss even one bullet that could cost you the match.<br/><br/>Needless to say, if your looking for something new (ironic) try counter strike. It will test your nerves tho, especially as a new player."

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,Good game and idea. But cheaters will kill that game.<br/>Upd. Free-to-play and cheaters killed it
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,"One of the worst games I’ve ever played in my life. At the beginning it was fun but the further we went, the worse it was. The game has one problem but it completely ruins all experience. Cheaters. Cheaters everywhere.
When you know that any time a team can come and kill you all without any effort, it’s annoying. The whole game turns into waiting for this moment, so why should I play it then? The prime version had to be something else with all this phone connection and a helpful system. But, in fact, it’s the same CS with cheaters.  
"
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,"This game is over-addictive. You can hate it, some features can totally piss you off but you return again and again and keep playing it. For me CS is a sort of guilty pleasures when you just can’t delete it but play from time to time only. However, if you like shooters, it’s a must-try."

Thank you Valve for this Game!"
Portal,"Portal Portal one of the best Games on Steam and also from Valve himself. 
What is Portal?
Portal is a Puzzle Game in ego perspective. You are sent through several Levels to contest, but what is behind the Scenes? A Game you shouldn't tell too much about, because the Game is great and everyone should play it themselves.
Pro: + Graphics (Year considering 2007) + top sound + super Witzig + nice Story + puzzle in ego perspective + Cool Sayings + Eastereggs Contra:-quite short-German Version Censored, whatever ... (Meanwhile UNCUT)
Verdict: Portal is one of the Games where I'd rather not say too much. The Game is very well done, but it is also still from a Time when Valve had much more Interest in its Customers than Today. The Game turns 10 Years old this Year and has lost nothing in irritation. Of course, the Graphics are no longer appropriate to our Time, but that doesn't matter much. The Levels are getting a bit heavier, but not so heavy that you don't have a Buck to keep playing. The cool Humor And witty Dialogue make the game even more interesting. I myself am bothered that Valve quickly censors some Things for Germany, but there are no Problems when you use a foreign Key.
If you have buck on Funny Things and are also into Puzzle Games, then take a look here, if not already done.

Portal,"Portal is a good tech demo but a boring short game. There is no point in playing Portal when there is Portal 2, which did everything better."
Portal,"Artificial intelligence that will decide everything for you.<br/><br/>To eat cake or not, to live or die. GLaDOS is a cold, rationed machine, creating a sterile, eugenic world where everything must be calculated.<br/><br/>That game shows us is that artificial intelligence can get out of control and overplay its hand. A device that was created to help people will turn into a tyrant and overseer."
Portal,"This is a clever game. It teaches you what you need when you need it. It is however, very short. It feels old yet not outdated. Thumbs up!"
Portal,"It's a little slow to start if you've played it once before and the bonus maps are kind of expecting pixel perfection, but there's not much else to say that hasn't been said a thousand times before."
Portal,"Revolutionary. Just incredible. Likely the best puzzle game I've played, and a game that I'll quickly recommend to anyone. Before this game I only thought of first person games as shooters, after I realized the potential for solving puzzles in 3D space. Every element of this game, even the sparse level design and story, works together to make this a cohesively built masterpiece."
Portal,I replayed and it’s still a fun puzzle game with a story more interesting than it has any right to be. Replaying years later I didn’t find the challenges that difficult though. Maybe in the back of my mind I remembered sort of how to do them. I don’t know. <br/><br/>Final Score: B
Portal,A really fun first-person ray-gun based puzzle game. Best one I've played so far. The setting and dark humour really work to make the game enjoyable. The cake is a lie.

Left 4 Dead 2,"Again, there are four Survivors to be denied by countless Zombies. Pardon, by countless Infected people. Left 4 Dead 2 Plays in The same Time frame as the first Part, only in other Places with other Heroes. The Backstory, however, remains as thin as usual: Some undefined Plague has erupted in the US, turning nearly the entire Population into squabble Brain-eaters. Now it is up to a Truffle of four People to make their way through the Southern United STATES to New Orleans; Reportedly one of the few Places on the Map where not everyone wants to say everything yet.
As in Left 4 Dead, the Journey is divided into Chapters with four to five Sections each, separated by a Charging sequence in a Shelter. If there were still four Chapters in the first Part, there are now five. As usual, You can experience them alone alongside three AI companions or--much more spassly--in the Team with three other players in five Levels of difficulty. This Co-op mode is more recommended because Game Mechanics and Presentation of Left 4 Dead 2 Become quick to drift after a few Sections. Only the panicked Screams, Warnings and general Breathing a Sigh of relief of real People, once another particularly crisp zombie attack, make the Title a real Experience. It was no different with the first Left 4 Dead. So a Headset is Mandatory!
Old Acquaintances Hunter, Boomer, Smoker, Tank and Witch are joined by the Spitter, the Charger and the Jockey. The Spitter spits, clearly. Highly toxic Acid spread widely on the Ground. The Charger looks like the little Brother from the Tank, he pushes towards his Opponents, lifts them off his Feet and then smashes them to the Ground over and over again. And the Jockey does exactly what the Name suggests: He sits on a Survivor's Back and almost completely takes Control of him. The Victim can only try desperately to hold against it, but usually he is directed specifically into a Zombie Horde or into the green Poison of a Spitter."
Left 4 Dead 2,"Left for Dead 2 is a First-person Shooter game that can be played as a Single Player, Co-op and Multiplayer. Unlike in Counterstrike, it is not a human Opponent, but a Zombies that is important here to fight And survive. The Zombies can be controlled by AI bots (artificial Inteligence) or other Players depending on the Mode. It is Recommended to start in Campaign Mode first. Here you get to know the different Maps, Weapons and Special Attacks of the Infected. In addition, you become more familiar with the Control and can customize settings in the Game. The Difficulty levels in Campaign Mode can be freely selected from Simple to Expert (depending on The Difficulty level, those Infected have more Life Points and deal more Damage). If you Feel ready for more Game Modes, you will quickly notice in Versus that not only Aiming, but also strategic Thinking and Teamplay are in demand here. In the Experiment, 4 Survivors each compete against 4 Specially infected people. People have the Goal of reaching the Shelter alive. It is always important to pay attention to the Team Members and to come To your Aid quickly when they are attacked. The Infected, in turn, try to work together in such a way that People do not reach their Destination as much as possible. This means different Tactics are used by the Infected, such as catching the last of the Group away and always the next Infected person intercepts the person who rushes to Help. Instantkills are Also very popular. These can be well run from Windows of tall Buildings or even house Roofs. If a Man is torn into the Depths by a Charm Rush here, he is immediately dead. But since many people now know these Positions, it is also important to work together as a Team. So a Smoker or Jockey can put a Survivor in the right Position for the Charger. There are no Limits to the Imagination of the attacks here! And it certainly doesn't get boring here! So If you want to rise to the Challenge, you should put this Game down quickly, but Be careful: There is an acute Risk of Addiction! (:"
Left 4 Dead 2,"Tried it and played couple of times. I'm usually into these types of FPS games but this seemed odd, too over the top. Got really repetitive and boring really quick."
Left 4 Dead 2,One of the best zombie game series ever it's even more fun with a friend I've played this with my brother probably 3 times really awesome story and characters.does have long missions but is very short story I hope one day they will announce a 3rd game very awesome game does hold its value for how short it is.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"After a few Hours of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, I decided to write a Review. 
The Story: Set roughly 100 Years after the Events of Oblivion, the story takes place in Skyrim, part of Tamirel. The Dragons have returned and so have the Dragon's Blood. As a great Hero, you now have to rid the fantasy world of the Dragons that spread Fear and Terror. When that happened, a War broke out in Skyrim (or ""Sky edge"" for that matter), in which one either chooses one Side or remains impartial. Through countless Decisions, one can determine the whole Career of the Character, from the Assassin who kills Nobles to the noble warrior who protects the poor Citizens from Bandits and Skevers.
The Gameplay: So After you have shaped your Hero from a Selection of several Breeds and spend almost hours (at least I can spend the ... ^^) embellishing the face with Details, which however really does not matter again, since you always have a Helmet anyway Wearing, it starts either in the 3rd person or 1st person. The simple Control you have after a few Hours of playing on it without any problems and even I didn't have to put anything great around. 
The Graphics: Skyrim is really a damn pretty Game that is made even more beautiful by numerous Mods from the Steam Workshop. However, I had a small Graphic Bug for a while, which is why Soldiers, Horses and Dragons were suddenly purple and Textures were also a Foreign Word as a result. But after a quick Review of the Game Files, that, too, was fixed again.
The Music: In My Opinion, Music plays a big Role in Skyrim. Whether during a Fight or Wandering Through meadows, the Music always fits. Alone when I first played Skyrim, I almost got Goosebumps in the Start Menu through the Music, which I still listen to in full Every Time. (Yes, I know I'm hobbyless:D). An epic Game just needs epic Music.
The Fight: The Hero is equipped with a Bar for Life, Magika and Endurance, which decreases depending on the Use or damage Assignment. With the Weapons, you have plenty of Choices, from the Bow to the Piston with a Shield or Spell to the Iron Two-handed, not to mention the Wands. Depending on what you choose, of course, the Character's Skills also improve. This can then be improved in the Driving menu. In addition, after each Step ascent, you can level up one of the three Bars (Life, Magika, Endurance). 
Other: What bothered me a little bit was that some of the NPC's Spokespeople had a few Difficulties with their Lyrics. It is not uncommon for your Counterpart to break off in the middle of the Sentence or for the Conversation to Be a little confused and not to be given a certain Answer at all, which is why you then have to reload the Score. Also, some Companions probably have a limited AI * hust * Lydia * hust * ... However, for me these are only small Criticisms, which have little Weight, but you can still mention it. But what I like very much is the DLC's Dragonborn, Hearthfire and Dawnguard. So If you should buy Skyrim, the Legendary Edition with all DLC's. It's really worth it a lot. Also commendable Is the still quite active community, which is constantly designing new Mods that are really helpful (everyone has certainly dropped off the Road and hasn't found them again. Then you look for the Path, at the End a rock face rides up at the 90 ° angle and then suddenly sees the Path again. That's why I got a Mod that represents the Road yellow:D). In the Beginning, however, the Opponents are frustrating, which are not co-leveled and are still very strong at the Beginning. An absolute Plus, in my Opinion, is the City Watches, which ask the Character if anyone would have stolen his Candy. :D
Conclusion: Definitely recommended, even if you didn't play the Predecessors. If the few Criticisms I've voiced weren't, I'd give The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim 10/10 with a clear Conscience, but that's how it stays with ""only"" 9/10. And even after so many Hours, I haven't seen it all and will continue to diligently hunt Dragons and Bandits. 
Feedback on the Review is welcome. ^^ And thus, Gamercookie over and out:)/b]"
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Great additions to combat, a streamlined altough a bit too simple level system and a great world to explore"
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Skyrim is a one of a kind roleplaying game where focusing on a class builds up your skills and your path, but with the free will to choose and change other stuff to try and play. Slaying dragons could not get any better. Not to mention the crazy NPCs. But above all, it is the huge open world that is offered what is the most crazy about Skyrim, that is fully open for exploration, full of wilderness, and dangers."
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Possibly the best game I've played so far, and it's been more than 10 years since its release.
Plot, graphics, soundtrack, gameplay and open world. Each genre of this game complements each other and they end up creating a masterpiece.
PS: Greybeards are the best."
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"What a universe.<br/><br/>After playing this game on my Xbox One in 2017 - or something like that, I had to give it another try, since I rushed it a little bit to move to another game asap, leaving those amazing sidequests untouched. Said and done. I played some questlines, like the College of Winterhold. Also, I completed two DLCs. Only after that, I completed the main story. And I have to say... I miss that kind of feeling in modern gaming.<br/><br/>At Skyrim, you have freedom. You can be whatever you want, choose your quests, dive deep into the lore and that universe slowly becomes more and more real. The characters were amazing equally.<br/><br/>The only thing Skyrim is arguably bad about is the gameplay. Yes, you have a lot of choices, but it`s not fluid as should be. But I`m confident that the next game will fix this.<br/><br/>One more thing: I believe the visuals of this game are criminally underrated. In 4k, on a good tv, it looks truly amazing.<br/><br/>
Sep 18, 2022, played in Master difficulty mostly."
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"I mean, it's Skyrim - so engrossing, so addictive, so janky. Glad I actually managed to complete the game this time around, and I really enjoyed the additional challenge and complexity of playing as a mage - although admittedly I had to depend more on weapons in the endgame and there's definitely some balancing issues. The combat system as a whole wasn't great when it was released and is certainly showing its age now. I enjoyed completing a lot of the Guild questlines for the first time as well - the most enjoyable of these was probably the Dark Brotherhood questline, and the least enjoyable/interesting was The Mages Guild."
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Good, but if you want something to keep you wanting a GREAT story, you'd be better off playing New Vegas"
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Honesty the best game i've ever played and i have bought this game on Ps3, Ps4 and Pc its fun quite enjoyable and i could play this game all day and not get bored of it Bethesda best project and this should've been co op instead of that disappointment known as elder scrolls online 11/10. "
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,This is the best mideval game ever made in my opinion I remember standing in line on 11-11-11 one of the most epic video game release dates ever in history the story the epic quests are amazing and fun really simple but satisfying combat then Bethesda decided to remaster the game on current gen consoles and it just made the game even more satisfying and the beautiful graphics are amazing and the mods make it really fun more games out there need to do that more often just imagine how much more popular the Witcher 3 would get with mods you would have a perfect game highly recommend this game greatest of all time a masterpiece for sure can't wait to see what elder scrolls 6 is going to be like.
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,There is a reason that skyrim has lasted so long and people still play it on every system imaginable. It’s because it’s a lot of fun. It does a fantastic job with the rpg mechanics. There are a bunch of different ways to play and you have to pick and choose what you want to specialize in.<br/><br/>Final Score: A
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Timeless classic. I will never be able to forget this game in my entire life. Whenever I think of in the lines of ""which game comes to my mind first when i think about my gaming past, which game would be the top"", I always think of Skyrim. Even though new legendary games such as RDR 2, God Of War and such; none of them still can't top the Skyrim for me. "

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Really buggy. The missions are boring as fuck. Not immersive at all. The best thing about it are the mods that make it better. But the vanilla game, I'll never understand how it got so popular.  "
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,Really great game. I have Skyrim since 2015 probably but only recently I've decided to give a decent run with tons of mods. Best decision I had this year. Helped a lot my mind to go through the pandemic.
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"Skyrim on Switch does what it is for - being Skyrim on Switch. Nothing unexpected here if you’ve ever played Skyrim anywhere else. A huge open world with a lot of content in it, a compelling story - everything from Skyrim is here. The best part is that it’s portable, so it’s a good chance to revisit the world of Skyrim while travelling to work."

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,"what can i say? it's skyrim , you know the rest."
BioShock Infinite,"Rewrite BioShock Infinite is one of the best Games I've played so far. Not only is the Main Game awesome, but the DLCs can also keep up with this Quality.
Main Game 1st Story The main hype reason-and that's right. There's just no exposure to the Story, it's constantly interesting and rips you through the Game. Also very successful Is the no less important Storytelling, which always happens in Gameplay and is limited to blunt waiting and Listening or Cutscenes only in Exceptional Situations.
2. Gameplay The classic shooter gameplay that consists of different Opponent classes (including Firemen, mobile Phone, Grenadiers, Patriots, gun Towers, etc.) and some, not particularly inspired weapons (Gun, revolver, sniper rifle, machine gun, etc.) Is greatly expanded: Eight different Forces that can be used both directly and as Traps, the Skyhook, which serves as a Melee (exuutions) weapon and extremely dynamic Means of transport, and Elizabeth herself, who is involved in the Fight with Medipacks, Ammunition and Salt, and at the same time with fixed Cracks Can ""summon"" cover, Gun Towers, allies, Bait and some other Aids.
Also making a good Contribution is the delightfully exaggerated Depiction of Violence, with which it looks incredibly satisfactory to kill an opponent with a lot of Blood.
3. Graphic Even if the Graphics in Detail do not look very beautiful (2D props, Women, Unlike Men, have gigantic eyes, Animations repeat frequently, etc.), it brings the Mood over very well. Especially the first Scenes are extremely impressive. As the Game progresses, it gets murkier, Lights flicker, the Mood becomes distressed and tense.
Even so, the Game manages to conjure up impressive Panoramas over and over again that just amaze you.
DLCs I recommend the Season Pass. This brings the following DLCs together at a good Discount.
Clash in the Clouds This is a fun Mode that fights waves of Enemies in four different Areas. Over Time, you can improve your Equipment, from weapons to Infusions and Clothing to Forces. Especially with the first Waves, it is later simply fun to finish overpowering Enemies.
Money earned in the Waves can be unlocked at the Museum Concept Arts, Making Ofs, Movies, Soundtracks and Models. In addition, your own Score can be compared with Friends or worldwide.
Burial at Sea-Episode 1 The Story perfectly complements that of the Main Game, sets an exciting Cliffhanger to Episode 2 and fits well into the BioShock universe. The Gameplay becomes calmer and refers to smaller Groups of opponents. The Storytelling, unlike the Main Game, is weaker and rather happens at the End-but then it gets really gripping.
Actually, I would recommend this DLC FOR Rapture alone. It's fascinating to walk and discover through the Underwater City, though not as well as in Columbia.
Burial at Sea-Episode 2 Where Episode 1 disappointed, Episode 2 puts three Raps on top. The Story is once again more complex, building Bridges between Columbia and Rapture, Elizabeth and Songbird, Little Sisters and Big Daddys. The Storytelling can now keep up with the Main Game and the Finale is almost more impressive.
The Gameplay this time is designed for Stealth. There are some Ways to bypass or relocate opponents, even if complex Tactics are not in place. A little annoying is that back tracking likes to be used, but that's forgivable.
However, the 1998 mode, in which no enemies can be killed in addition to the highest Degree Of Difficulty, is too simple because you can continue to stun enemies.
After Playing Through all of these, I can rightly say that the Story is one of the best, if not the best, in History. Not only Are Columbia fans impressed in the DLCs, but BioShock 1 &amp; 2 players are also discovering new Aspects.

BioShock Infinite,"it's a fucking mess<br/>it's not terrible, it is worth playing, but for years i've wondered why people absolutely hated it <br/>and now i get it lmao<br/><br/>the easiest thing to talk about is how the mechanics were downgraded into being Call of Duty but with plas- vigors and a hook ig<br/>it's not as bad as that sounds, but it's very simplistic<br/>there was very little strategy in how i'd play the game, i just stuck with a couple weapons i liked and that was that<br/>this was done for the sake of the new heavy narrative focus, but it didn't have to be that way<br/>actually, this game didn't have to be a shooter to begin with<br/><br/>this would have been the perfect opportunity to return to the immersive sim style gameplay that made the shock series a thing, because the absurd violence on display is precisely why the term ""ludo narrative dissonance"" became the bane of any games-writer's vocabulary<br/>the story isn't necessarily about violence, but it does in some degree seek to critique booker's violent nature<br/>lacking player choice IS part of the game's narrative, but you could've still played with that idea while allowing the player more agency to engage with the game beyond murdering people in ways that clash so fucking hard with the strengths of the game's narrative and presentation<br/>because the strengths of the game have absolutely nothing to do with that<br/><br/>this is a gorgeous game, as always there's a lot of environmental storytelling that<br/>while not very subtle like<br/>ever<br/>it's still good to have there - bioshock has NEVER been subtle<br/>and it's all wasted when the narrative is constantly pushing you forward<br/>bioshock 1 and 2 encouraged you to explore more often than not, even if they both had a little arrow guiding you to your next objective constantly<br/><br/>i lack the time or patience to go super in depth with the narrative, but i'll touch on a few things of personal note<br/><br/>how the game handles the revolutionary aspect of its fiction is fucking terrible, it's some game of thrones season 8 bullshit<br/>that ""the oppressed are really just as bad as the oppressors"" centrist drivel that only works because the writers purposefully made their revolutionist side of the conflict turn into The Bad Thing<br/>you'll hear booker say ""they're all terrible, all grifters"" or whatever before the Vox Populi have been shown to be anything but the thing that Columbia needs<br/>when shortly before then he'd be saying that sometimes places need people like the Vox<br/>as if something happened to make him change his mind beyond the leader being mean to him<br/>some of this is addressed in the game's dlc, but it does very little to excuse the complete mistreatment of this aspect of the game given that it goes to great lengths to point out that Columbia is stupidly racist <br/><br/>the alternate reality aspect is something that i feel gets too much hate, as i honestly could care fucking less about whether or not it makes pure logical sense<br/>i do feel that it's very simplistic, but suspend your disbelief a bit and it's easy for it to end up working out<br/>the dynamic between Booker and Elizabeth makes the game worth playing alone, and their conclusions are worth the fuckery written to get them there<br/>the fuckery written to turn Daisy Fitzroy into ""murdering white kids is cool, actually"" isn't<br/>i think there is a line between contrivance that's okay and contrivance that's not<br/>but, ideally, you wouldn't have either, which is why i'm not gonna even begin to call the game's narrative clever or standout<br/><br/>it's well done in enough aspects to warrant the trip but there's a reason why the game nowadays has a lot of critics, and if i felt more inclined i could probably write a full on essay about it<br/><br/>but for now, it was okay"
BioShock Infinite,"A mess.<br/>Gameplay is ok, bosses are bad, the story is a complete mess that is lauded as a masterpiece."
BioShock Infinite,"Overall: 8.5/10<br/>Gameplay: 8/10<br/>Story: 9/10<br/>Music: 8.5/10<br/><br/>(WIP) Really phenomenal game. More in depth review to come, but well worth the play. Mechanics are a lot of fun, building on the core things that made Bioshock as a series shine and adding twists that only a city in the sky could allow. The story is compelling and lovely, and the twists are often genuinely unexpected. By the end you are emotionally attached to the characters, and the game does what Bioshocks do best: leaving you with a slight existential dread and awe, wondering what the ending of the game truly meant, and wanting to replay it again to find any hints you missed. "
BioShock Infinite,"Total mind boggling experience playing this sci-fi/fantasy/action/adventure game (who knows the right genre?).

BioShock Infinite,"<div>I played BioShock Infinite on the PS3 a few years back but it never left my thoughts. I'm not one for FPS games, but this one...

The gameplay itself! It's easy and while I found the ""switching powers"" mechanics a bit tricky, I LOVED IT! Give me those powers fueled by plasmids and all.

Red Dead Redemption 2,"The story is a masterclass in character development, with a rich cast of characters that are all well-written and expertly voice-acted. The game's themes of loyalty, betrayal, and morality are explored in a nuanced and thought-provoking way that will leave players thinking long after the credits roll.

The game's mechanics are also top-notch, with smooth and intuitive controls that make everything from horseback riding to gunfights feel satisfying and realistic. The online multiplayer mode adds even more replayability, with various activities and challenges to keep players coming back for more.

Overall, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece of a game that is well worth the investment of time and money. Its immersive world, gripping story, and expertly crafted gameplay make it a must-play for any fan of Westerns or open-world adventure games."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Wow just wow! I think I played the story 3 times and I am still enjoying it. It`s just perfect the characters, the story, the protagonist! In my mind Rockstar made a masterpiece in gaming! I can recommend it to anybody who wants to play a modern masterpiece of a western game! "
Red Dead Redemption 2,"i once played poker for 4 hours against an NPC, i lost. However i did shit myself during the poker match and that was enough to let me enjoy the beauty that is this masterpiece 15/10"
Red Dead Redemption 2,"An incredible feat in gaming.  Truly a masterpiece.  I've never played a game that was so consistently and deeply immersive.  The story is great, the characters are fantastic, the animations carry weight, the gameplay is slow but that only helps the immersion and cowboy sim feel of it.  Pulling from influences in western movies, traditional American folk tales and folk music, the Hudson River school of art, and real history, it creates a world that feels real, lived in, and instantly familiar. "
Red Dead Redemption 2,"I am not wanting to finish this game because of it's quality, seriously, it is in my top 3 games of life "
Red Dead Redemption 2,"The first and only game that I went for 100% completion. There is no better game than this in terms of immersive story telling, world building, characters you actually care about, graphics and sound. When the end came around (before the long epilogue), I think I actually teared up. No game has ever made me tear up. Rockstar, please stop wasting your precious developing resources on Red Dead Online and make a tru RDR 2 DLC, or get on with your next massive open world project. "
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Rockstar has undoubtedly created a piece of art. The story is long and a bit slow in the beginning, but tastes like a mature wine with an aftertaste of your action's consequences. It looks much more like a classic book than a movie.<br/><br/>Story: remarkable with a lot of details<br/>Soundtrack: memorable<br/>Gameplay: fun with a lot of shooting<br/>Graphics: awe-inspiring"
Red Dead Redemption 2,Very good game. Definitely a long haul game but the quality of detail and engaging world is top tier. Where this game really shines though is it’s protagonist. One of the best written and real characters we’ve ever seen in a game hands down. 
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Pros:<br/>+ atmosphere<br/>+ characters<br/>+ really alive world<br/>+ soundtrack<br/>+ little stuff<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- bugs<br/>- outdated graphics<br/><br/>+- maybe can be slow but this is western genre tradition<br/>+- gameplay not bad but can be boring<br/><br/>Conclusion: this is f*ckin open-world game from Rockstar, just play this"
Red Dead Redemption 2,"My personal choice for the greatest videogame ever made as of 2020. Not only is the Van Der Linde gang's saga, An utterly heartbreaking slow death, But it is one written which such poise and consideration that it remains burned into my mind to this day. It is a game that against all odds is utterly uncompromising in it's vision and scope and the world that you will inhabit and the stories you will experience will be folktales in your gaming portfolio for years to come. <br/><br/>It often feels restrained and realistic. You will find yourself giddy for a heist, and then tapping your feet aching to get out of danger for the sake of your gang members. You have such a raw connection to them through learning them like a book as you progress through the story, They remind you why you keep playing even when the game has a few lukewarm missions and they remain consistently entertaining with campside stories and friendly insults in passing. This is a feature of the game that extends to wildlife as well. Red Dead 2 remains remarkably faithful in simulating the habitats and daily activities of hundreds of species. <br/><br/>It all feels so real and it draws you into the game bit by bit as you pick your way through the game's content. And in the very end it all remains just as real life memories do, Moments. Listening to the horses hooves clod off the red sand as I slammed my way through a particularly bad sandstorm, Watching townsfolk look up from their newspaper to eye me like vultures as I saunter into town for the first time, Watching a boy sprint in the other direction as he sees me reach for my revolver. <br/><br/>Experience this world, Experience Arthur's story and remember to take your time before it all passes like a gust of frontier wind. "
Red Dead Redemption 2,This game was absolutely fucking amazing. Outstanding work. Until you get to the shitty fucking epilogue and have to go through a ranch hand tutorial. Fuck that. That was an amazing experience followed by the most painful fucking gameplay ever. I dont know how but Rockstar made me hate this game I fell in love with.
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Rockstar really outdid themselves with this one. When I picked up this game, I was expecting business as usual.  But was I wrong! Red Dead Redemption 2 is a technical, visual, and narrative accomplishment. As I have written in past reviews, the testament of a good sequel, is that it somehow furthers the things that were established in the first game. Gameplay, story and characters, and visuals are all major elements that a good sequel manages to push and make better. The game is a prequel to 2010's Red Dead Redemption. Set in 1899, the age of outlaws is coming to an end. The Van der Line gang struggles to survive as they against nature, government forces and outlaws. The character you play as is Arthur Morgan. Initial footage of this character bothered me because I found his voice to be far too exaggerated.  But for whatever reason my mind was changed. Arthur is similar to John Marston in Red Dead Redemption. Both of these characters can be cruel and violent men, but the narrative pushes the player player give the character  some redeeming qualities or some sort of arc that goes from bad/apathetic to good. Other familiar faces from Red Dead Redemption are prominently featured in this game. The gameplay has dramatically improved. The gunplay and action isn't as rudimentary and choppy as it was in Red Dead Redemption. The survival aspects of the game have taken front and center and prove to be quite vital in your survival and the survival of the gang. The alarming and hilarious amount of detail this game has both visually and technically is quite impressive. The open world is much bigger than Red Dead Redemption with various diverse regions to travel through and a plethora of random encounters that border on the frightening to the hilarious. This is probably one of the best games ever made. I maintain that God of War (2018) deserved its award for Game of the Year.  But that does not diminish this game by any means. It is truly a remarkable game that has hopefully changed things forever. If there is one game that everyone should play, it is this game.
<br/><br/> Rating- 5/5 A Masterpiece

Red Dead Redemption 2,"It is a great game overall, but in terms of storyline, it could be better. The world, possibilities, graphics, gameplay, all feel stunning. Worth playing, but not twice."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"9.5/10<br/><br/>There is not much to say, this game is an epic, it really leaves us speechless with what it managed to achieve. Only the epilogue has a lower quality, because it is also too long in my opinion."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"It's the best game I ever played. You absolutely fall in love with it, have compassion for Arthur, greatest character ever made. Absolutely amazing! 10/10"
Red Dead Redemption 2,This game is what everyone wants on GTA V <br/>- Nobody bothers anyone<br/>- the game chat is pretty funny considering the fact everyone talks with country accents<br/>- no op weapons for no reasons<br/>- gives everyone what they want<br/>only flaw is that we cant have private sessions or director mode which is fine considering how everyone is in the lobby<br/>8.5/10
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is the greatest video game ever made. I’ve never been more immersed in a game than in this wonderful western world.  The story was fantastic. Arthur Morgan is the best character a video game has ever had. The visuals of this game were spectacular (minus a few character models that weren’t bad, but were not great). The sound is great. The level of detail in this game has never been done before, whatever game is second place isn’t close. <br/><br/>Some people complained about the controls or feel for the game. I did not. The game makes you take deliberate actions but I found my Arthur Morgan was a badass gunslinger who didn’t have difficulty completing his tasks. Some people complained that this games pacing (specifically the opening) is too slow. I did not. I think the slow beginning forces you to pay attention to the incredible detail this game has to offer, and it does it in a way where you just think you are discovering things on your own.<br/><br/>This game took ~45 hours to complete and usually I am fatigued at that point and just pushing towards the finish line. I wasn’t fatigued. This game kept me fully engaged and entertained for that long, and it barely has any rpg mechanics. I wasn’t grinding for the next perk or upgrade or piece of equipment that makes my character better and gives me a sense of accomplishment. I was buying Arthur a sweet jacket and trimming his beard. I loved every minute of it. I don’t know how they pulled that off.<br/><br/>Final Score: A++"
Red Dead Redemption 2,The greatest Western story ever told. Transcends its medium and becomes one of the greatest pieces ever made. Very few games have ever made me care so deeply for a character’s well being and wanting them to be the best person they can be. 
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Simply the greatest game ever made, which was my opinion when the first one was released. It's story is perfectly written and captivates you and sucks you in from the very begining to the very end. Outstanding!"
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Red Dead Redemption is a game I always remember. I was a year out of college and sort of didn't know what I was going to do with my life. I remember being down in the dumps a bit living with my roommate in Concord NH. I loved Rockstar games and remembering looking up Red Dead Revolver and it looking like a game I probably wasn't too interested in. I picked up Red Dead being skeptical and it ended up being one of my favorite games. A character you could become obsessed with, John Marston. <br/><br/>Cut to 2019 and Red Dead Redemption has been replaced. That gunslinger I once loved has been replaced by a caring bad guy who is self-aware of the bad deeds he continues to do. He can't help himself and he knows that, which is probably why I love his character so much. With one of the realist villains I can remember with Dutch Van Der Linde and some of the most realistic gameplay in a videogame, I was enamored for 80 plus hours of gameplay. <br/><br/>I can't wait to remember it again."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"First English then German:
<br/><br/> I was really looking forward to Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) back then. Back then, in the middle of chapter 3, I benched the game after almost 30 hours in. In June 2020 I started it again and finished the game.

Why did I quit back then?

I am rarely a fan of Open-World Games and the game was just too much for me. Too much of everything. It had vast open world, too many useless side quests, too many challenges. I like to lose myself in open worlds and then I'm ""full"" before the story is finished.

I liked the story, but there is no tension in the first 3 chapters. Now that I've finished the game, the first 3 chapters are really important to build the characters and a bond to the characters. The big problem with RDR2 is that everything just feels so slow. For every little action something has to be pressed, which otherwise is done automatically for the user experience in other games. And then there's the frequency with which the game forces you to walk at the games pace rather than your own. A lot of missions start with ""Follow X character to X position"", where you have to walk at a snail's pace while listening to the dialogue. It's as if the game is full of hidden cutscenes that disguise themselves as gameplay.

Unfortunately, RDR2 suffers from many typical Rockstar problems. Clumsy controls, erroneous interactions (have fun trying to reposition yourself a few centimetres at a time to get a certain prompt to light up).

RDR2 thrives on realism and yet it goes too far. Take looting as an example. You want to loot some dead victims after a big gun battle? Be prepared for the allies yelling at you to hurry. If you loot 10 people, it'll take five minutes. Spontaneously it doesn't sound too bad, but in this game you shoot and loot hundreds of people.

The world is full of things to do. Many tasks are unfortunately only pure tedious work. When I played the game, I thought it would be good and important to collect meat/furs for the camp. This is, for the progress of the game, completely unimportant and does not have to be done. In the whole new game run I have not brought a single animal to the camp.

The attempt to catch a legendary fish can take 10 minutes, until the analog stick is constantly turned. Treasure maps are so vague that most of the time they are not readable. It's strange because when you're on a mission, the game gives you lots of information and instructions, but outside a mission and you're alone with little to no clues. Of course this should encourage you to explore - unfortunately it failed with me. After I spent too many hours with it in the early game, I didn't feel like it any more and benched the game.

Now almost 2 weeks ago I started the game again and finished it. With the knowledge that I should not ""waste"" any time. So I rode from mission to mission and experienced a great story.

It is definitely not a bad game. Not at all. It has the story, it has the music, it has the characters, it has the depth. Unfortunately, the finishing touches were missing in too many places and Rockstar didn't realize when realism becomes annoying and a handicap.

I rate my second game run with a ⅘. But if I would have to play the game the way it was supposed to be played, I would give the game a ⅖.<br/><br/>German:
<br/><br/> Ich habe mich damals sehr auf Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) gefreut. Knappe 30 Stunden Spielzeit, mitten im Kapitel 3, habe ich damals das Spiel abgebrochen. Im Juni 2020 habe ich das Spiel erneut angefangen und beendet.

Wieso habe ich damals abgebrochen?

Ich bin selten Fan von Open-World Games und das Spiel war mir einfach zu viel. Zu viel von allem. Es hatte eine zu große Welt, zu viele unnütze Nebenquest, zu viele Challenges. Ich verliere mich gerne in zu großen Welten und bin dann “satt” bevor die Story beendet ist.

Die Story gefiel mir gut, allerdings kommt in den ersten 3 Kapiteln keine Spannung vorhanden. Jetzt nachdem ich das Spiel beendet habe, sind die ersten 3 Kapitel wirklich wichtig um die Charaktere und eine Bindung zu den Charakteren aufzubauen. Das große Problem von RDR2 ist, dass sich einfach alles so langsam anfühlt. Für jede kleine Aktion muss etwas gedrückt werden, das sonst für die Benutzererfahrung in anderen Spielen automatisch erfolgt. Und dann gibt es die Häufigkeit, mit der das Spiel einen dazu zwingt, in seinem Tempo zu gehen, anstatt im eigenen. Sehr viele Missionen beginnen mit ""Folge X-Charakter zu X-Position"", wo du im Schneckentempo gehen musst, während du den Dialog hörst. Es ist, als ob das Spiel voller versteckter Zwischensequenzen ist, die sich als Gameplay tarnen.

Leider leidet RDR2 unter vielen typischen Problemen von Rockstar. Klobige Steuerelemente, fehlerhafte Interaktionen (viel Spaß beim Versuch, sich ständig ein paar cm neu zu positionieren, um eine bestimmte Aufforderung zum Aufleuchten zu erhalten). Apropos, es ist viel zu leicht, in diesem Spiel die Ehre zu verlieren. Das zufällige Anstoßen an jemanden, was aufgrund der schrecklichen Kontrollen häufig vorkommt, kann dazu führen, dass er wütend wird und einen angreift. Wenn man sich dann wehrt, ist die ganze Stadt hinter einem los.

RDR2 lebt vom Realismus und doch geht es dort zu weit. Nehmen wir das Looten mal als Beispiel. Willst du ein paar tote Opfer nach einem großen Schusswechsel plündern? Sei darauf vorbereitet, dass die Verbündeten einen ständig anschreien, man solle sich beeilen. Wenn man 10 Leute lootet, dauert das knappe 5 Minuten. Hört sich spontan nicht allzu schlimm an, jedoch erschießt man in dem Spiel hunderte von Menschen.

Die Welt ist stecke voller Dinge, die zu tun sind. Viele Aufgaben sind leider nur reine mühsame Fleißaufgaben. Als ich das Spiel damals gespielt habe, habe ich gedacht es wäre gut und wichtig Fleisch/Pelze für das Camp zu sammeln. Dies ist, für den Spielfortschritt etc. vollkommen unwichtig und muss nicht gemacht werden. Im ganzen neuen Spieldurchlauf habe ich kein einziges Tier zum Camp gebracht.

Der Versuch, einen legendären Fisch zu fangen, kann 10 Minuten dauern, bis der Analogstick ständig gedreht wird. Schatzkarten sind so vage, dass sie die meiste Zeit nicht lesbar sind. Es ist seltsam, denn wenn du in einer Mission bist, gibt dir das Spiel viele Informationen und Anweisungen, aber alles außerhalb einer Mission und du bist allein mit wenig bis gar keinen Hinweisen. Man hat keine Ahnung, wo es ist und das Spiel sagt es einem nicht. Klar soll dies zum Erkunden animieren - schlug leider bei mir fehl. Nachdem ich zu viele Stunden damit im frühen Spiel verbracht habe, hatte ich keine Lust mehr und habe das Spiel abgebrochen.

Nun vor knapp 2 Wochen habe ich das Spiel erneut gestartet und es beendet. Mit dem Wissen, das ich keine Zeit ""verschwenden"" soll. Ich bin also von Mission zu Mission geritten und habe eine grandiose Story erlebt.

Es ist definitiv kein schlechtes Spiel. Überhaupt nicht. Es hat die Geschichte, es hat die Musik, es hat die Charaktere, es hat die Tiefe. Leider fehlte an zu vielen Stellen der letzte Schliff und Rockstar erkannte nicht, wann Realismus zur lästigen Arbeit und Behinderung wird.

Meinen zweiten Spieldurchlauf bewerte ich mit einer ⅘. Würde ich das Spiel allerdings so durchspielen müssen, wie es eigentlich vorgesehen wurde, würde ich dem Spiel eine ⅖ geben."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"The campaign was incredible, I'd never been so engrossed in a single-player experience. It's like a whole other life you live as Arthur Morgan."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"After finishing this game, every other game feels like garbage and certainly not worth to be paid with the same currency."
Red Dead Redemption 2,This is by far the best video game ever I LOVE this game it’s so easy to get lost in and there are so many things to do. Rockstar Games is my favorite game company and the usually do an exceptional job with their games and this exceeded exceptional by my standards. 
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2 is a colossal disappointment, and surely not a masterpiece. “Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece. 10/10…” wrote just about every video game critic on the internet. What? Has everyone been brainwashed? With all of the extremely high critical acclaim, it was natural for me to go into Rockstar’s RDR2 with extremely high expectations. What I was met with was an aggravating, boring, mess of a sequel. This is what everyone has been freaking out about? Are you kidding? What has the gaming community’s taste gone to? I cannot properly judge the entire game because I have not had the time to complete it yet, but I’ve already spent a great deal of time with its tedious introduction. The following criticisms are based off of what I’ve picked up in the first two chapters alone.<br/><br/>Let’s start by saying this: Red Dead Redemption 2 is great… for an interactive movie. That’s what a large portion of this game feels like: a cinematic experience over a gaming experience. Rockstar decided to make RDR2 a prequel to the first game. The first Red Dead Redemption didn’t involve much plot. You are given the protagonist, John Marston, and introduced to the hunted antagonist, Bill Williamson. It gets a little more complicated later, but it was generally simple. RDR2 heavily involves its innumerable characters, especially at the beginning of the game. The first chapter is nothing short of a long, dragging, no-fun zone.<br/><br/>There’s about five minutes of legitimate gameplay in the first mission. If you decide to watch the uninteresting cutscenes, then a great deal of time is spent watching them, and then riding your horse. Then the game gives you about 5-10 minutes of what would be considered fun: taking down enemies. Then it is time to loot and travel back to your camp again to repeat the same process. This introduction leaves a bad first impression that doesn’t improve much.<br/><br/>Back to the first point: RDR2 is fundamentally an interactive movie. Rockstar does not care much about the player at all. Rockstar tries to make you care about their characters. Character development and an interesting plot are great when you’re watching a movie or TV show, or reading a book, but Rockstar does not seem to understand that this is a video game. A player picks up their controller to have complete agency over their character. RDR2 has barely any, and it is so tedious with its brief animations, constant cutscenes, conversing NPCs (non-playable characters), and method of traveling that playing it feels more like a movie you have to press a button to once a minute to keep it running.<br/><br/>The purpose of spending lengthy amounts of time on your horse is to get a sense of the map, and to admire the beauty of the game along with its abundant amount of detail that Rockstar littered throughout it. This is something many critics and fans have been praising emphatically: the detail. Detail is enjoyable, but much of it serves no purpose other than just gazing at it. It’s not wrong for a game to look beautiful, but players still misunderstand that Rockstar failed to create an engaging experience by combining beauty and detail with enjoyable gameplay (the fact that the ""cinematic camera"" exists doesn't help). The characters, detail, and gameplay are all incoherent with one another in RDR2.<br/><br/>Another factor that bruised Rockstar was realism. This explains every single brief animation and unnecessary task. At one point in the 2nd chapter, a message pops up on the screen telling the player that they should shave their character’s beard because it’s getting too long. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what video games have come to, this is what everyone is praising. Red Dead Redemption 2, the video game meant to be watched, the video game meant to mimic our boring lives.<br/><br/>RDR2 also disappoints in comparison to its predecessor in some ways. The controls are much more restrained and harder to handle than the loose, breezy controls of the first one, as well as the unnecessary addition of convoluted inventories for your items and practically useless horse commodities. Simple equals better, Rockstar.<br/><br/>Rockstar spent so much time polishing detail, writing characters, and worrying about realism that they forgot to make a fun gaming experience. Rockstar is not the only game developer who includes these elements in their games, but Rockstar stressed them so much in this game that they failed at making it fun to play. Again, I have not played it the entire way through, nor is the whole game like this, but it did not leave me with a good first impression. I only hope that the game improves, and that I have the patience to push through the tedious sections to complete it. And keep in mind that this is just my opinion. I am clearly in a really small minority."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"beautiful and immersive with a good story, but even more so boring, mechanically dated, and tedious. all the details are great, but the gameplay is a legitimate chore.<br/><br/>how did this happen?"
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Absolute shit.<br/><br/>Sure, the gameplay is absolutely terrible, absolutely everything can and will kill you at random in the name of ""realism,"" and the game will constantly take your weapons away, but your horse's testicles will shrink when it's cold, so 10/10 GOTY<br/><br/>Fuck Rockstar for this one, seriously. Absolutely anything you do that the game thinks might be fun will be met with punishment."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"A bland, western grind. Red Dead Redemption 2's cinematics and atmosphere are enough to draw you in for a solid few hours of first-time gameplay. Though well before the midway game point, the missions begin to become tedious and repetitive - ""go to X point and talk to X person before riding to X point and shooting X"". Although there is enough detail in this beautiful western world to keep you busy exploring for days - the clumsy controls, broken law system, tedious hunting and crafting and dull traveling become a nuisance and makes we wonder if this game is as polished as it should have been. I've been a massive Rockstar Fan since the very first GTA and have played GTA V multiple times on multiple consoles but there is something really lacking in the main mission quests and character progression, by the midway point I was really pushing myself to get through the main story and had little difference between new game Arthur and End Game Arthur (besides most of the characters becoming frustrating and unlikable - WHERE ARE YOU LEENNAAY?). I really have to question the review sites who have posted this as being almost perfect - it's an 80 out of 100 MAX."
Red Dead Redemption 2,"Controls like a ton of bricks sometimes, particularly when walking around in confined environments, and sometimes the NPCs got annoying, always yelling at you to do stuff. They're minor complaints because I found this to be and immensely fun playground, it's not too big, not some 500 hour Fallout style game. So happy that a lot of this wasn't DLC, it's all important to the story, so why not put it in there? It's a great escape."

Red Dead Redemption 2,"RDR2 is such a ride, it is filled with a lot of feelings from happiness to enraged revenge. I think that to this point there’s no such experience as Red Dead Redemption 2, is as raw and slow as the developers wanted it to be, for me it was for the best but sometimes it felt a little tiresome or repetitive, then again is so masterfully crafted that even that seems on purpose. More often than not, also, it seemed to me more like a MMO game than a single placer AAA game, the thing is massive and almost every chapter feels like a AAA game on itself. Everything in this game begs to be praised, the writing (which is magnificent), the music, the animation, sound, even the Graphic design of labels of food, billboards is Amazing.<br/><br/>I’m not sure if I’m a big fan of westerns but I sure like a lot of them, and similar to the last entry, this game has a lot of references, even tho in my opinión it seemed to me that they took a lot of inspiration from Tarantino’s D’jango Unchained and Hateful Eight in a very good way. There’s a lot of things and themes they managed to discuss here, current themes that can easily be applied in the game’s exaggerated and romanticized World and they did it great.<br/><br/>As for its main character, I fell in love with Arthur from start, it has the perfect balance of cold killer and sweet guy, and as outrageous that sounds it Works flawlessly, Arthur is now easily one of my top 5 characters in gaming. Not everything in this game is perfect, there are some minor technical issues that can be sometimes frustrating but never a big deal, also there's a lot of ""walking"" both at feet and on horse so if that's a problem to you, maybe you can skip this game, but it also encourages you to explore and find new things at every corner, similar to Breath of the Wild. <br/><br/>I think that this game is not for everyone, I think I can compare to a Nolan movie, sure is a blockbuster Hollywood movie but is well done and has a lot to say that can separate itself from the rest. I love how the characters made me feel angry, happy and sad, and those moments where I totally transformed into a gunslinger will stay with me for the years to come."

Life is Strange,"The game can be compared to the telltale games, although I like the art style and the music in life is Strange all the more. Everything seems so everyday and authentic (the time travel skills left out). Even though I was even more enthusiastic about the pre-quel and generally I still want the version for the mobile phone, I was a little disappointed at the end. Especially in episode 5, several bugs appeared.
As an example, in the end sequence the Men music was constantly playing. Not even the end music appeared until I restarted the game. This initially destroys the entire atmosphere. And some of maxine's animations did not even exist when she started talking (in a completely animated sequence). And somehow david appeared in the picture much earlier, which looked a bit funny, as he was stuck in the table: D
If sometimes the limbs were penetrable or even temporarily invisible, I can still understand. But especially the music really disturbed me in the end.
And of course there was the star deduction, because I've been waiting four months for the last two episodes. And getting those bugs included is a bit sad. Too bad, otherwise it has been perfect content for me. Not technically yet.

Life is Strange,"Update 2:
Finally there, but it still applies the comment below. Software manufacturers or distributors who come up with something like that do not even belong in the store. Serise providers name at least one date.
Paid in December and until today not all parts get. Then the money also only book off when you deliver. The game itself is very pretty and the story exciting. Again: When will 4 and 5 come?
Update: Even on demand no clear help. It was only the customer service and not involved in the development. - Yes, who the hell else is in charge of you ??? Instead, it is referred to just one should look fter in Itunes. This is more than cheeky and borders on rip-off. I will boycott such business models in the future and generally buy nothing more from Square Enix.

Life is Strange,Good story and rich twilight-like west coast small town school atmosphere of first episodes. Great story driven game before mid episode 4. After that story develops weirdly and episode 5 feels overextended.<br/><br/>8 selfies of 10
Life is Strange,"This game is powerful. <br/><br/>For some reason, even though that's my second playthrough, I can stop being emotionally damaged by this game. Actually, knowing some stuff about certain characters made some minor decisions harder. The difference they made objectively was not high, but your perception around it is what really matters. Making someone laugh, feel motivated, or pissed. You feel all of this with them, and I love this. That's only possible because of how sensitive the creators were and how amazingly developed and relatable the characters truly are.<br/><br/>Talking about sensitivity... hands down. That is one of the best soundtracks ever selected. OST included. I could listen to the main theme for hours. This game would not be that good without those tracks.<br/><br/>But it is perfect? no. But that was the dev's fault? Also no. The graphics and other technical elements could be better. Facial expressions feel off sometimes and clearly characters could not express themselves the way they should. Obviously, that's a financial problem, so it's understandable. And, at least, the actors nail it. Amazing performances.<br/><br/>
If you still haven't played this masterpiece, what are you waiting for?"
Life is Strange,"[i]Life Is Strange[/i] is probably a masterpiece full of flaws. It's one of my favorite [i]walking simulator[/i] games and it has one of the most memorable characters and feelings that i had in a game.

[b]Graphically[/b] is great, has a paint filter with pencil drawings on everything with a soft pastel palette which gives the game a dreamy and teen vibe overall. It's not very detailed and a lot of the photographs and graphics on the walls look like hand drawings. 

The [b]soundtrack[/b] is amazing, composed by a lot of indie artists, match the hipster vibe of our protagonist [i]Max[/i] and the moody and sad story, it goes incredibly well at all times, really fits every scene in particular and as a whole game scenario. 

[b]Voice acting[/b] is decent, the timbre of the voices is good but the speech feels sometimes weak. The bad lip-syncing doesn't help at all sadly. You probably gonna find a lot of people who would say that [i]Max[/i] has a very questionable voice acting, which is an opinion that i also had in the first episode, but the more you know her, the more than that shy and scared voice becomes essential for her as a character.

[b]Gameplay[/b] is very simple, just a point and click mechanic with an interesting time travel feature that makes the game fresher given that u cant take every path the game offers (usually) and unlock some extra dialog. This same feature makes the game impossible to fail, which along with the simplicity of the game as a whole, it becomes one of the most accessibles games out there.

[b]I liked[/b] the mystery plot of the story, and how the game focuses on characters, giving a lot of dialogue, reading journals, SMS, and how the environment itself tells you a story every time. You get to know characters directly (by pure dialog) and very indirectly, like by just looking at the scenario.
The main plot, the power of time travel, makes the game very loose to interpretation which in addition to the overall emotional drama, makes it very personal. Although, you should take into consideration that the game will never resolve this and it is their intention. The real main plot is the relationship between [i]Max and Chloe[/i] and the death of the last one.
Dialogs are very good for the most part, they are very genuine and representative for which character is speaking and the time and scenario of the game.
Characters are the best part of the game, most of them are very likeable and unique. [i]Max and Chloe[/i] are probably two of my favorite characters on a videogame ever, both very different but complementaries. [i]Max[/i] makes a great protagonist for a [i]walking simulator[/i] given her introspective nature, emotional but very introverted mind with a power that forces her to interact with the world, which, she isn't very good at it, making her very genuine and honest at all times. Her power acts as a second chance for every event that she thought of surpassing her comfort in order to do what she really wanted to, a thing that is very connected to her blame for never answering her best friend that now is dead. [i]Chloe[/i] makes the perfect drama character given her tragic nature, loneliness, and rebellious personality, making her very relatable.

[b]The main problem[/b] i can find on this game, that it is on every [i]Life of Strange[/i] game, and in a lot of these [i]walking sim / interactive story [/i]games, is that the end is reduced to a binary choice and that all the choices you choose before that, doesn't matter. In fact, you can play the last chapter and still complete the game. However, i think because of the nature of the main plot and because the choices do matter before the end and are reflected in the world, this game is all about the progress before the ending, and i got a lot of entertainment and emotions during it that i forgot the negativity i felt in the ending. 

Overall, i think if you are a person that loves story-driven games, you like emotional dramas and want a very accessible game, Life Is Strange might be the masterpiece that you are looking for, i don't want to spoil anything, but there is at least one episode that makes the game worth it."
Life is Strange,"Absolutely no idea why or how so many people love this game. Granted, there's a kind of peacefulness and nostalgia that a lot of the more slice-of-life moments capture, which I for the most part enjoyed. I think this is captured best in the early episodes where you're just walking around the school, examining items and listening to the relaxing and autumnal indie-folk soundtrack - that or the scene where you're exploring Chloe's room and Lua by Bright Eyes Starts playing. I found myself being able to get lost in the peaceful and somewhat bittersweet rhythms of high school life during these segments. <br/><br/>However, any segment of the game where a character opens their mouth is somewhat of a disaster. Really, truly, a terrible depiction of high school students. To their credit, a lot of games and movies and tv shows get high schoolers wrong, but this game is truly something else. It reads like it was written by someone who never went to high school in the USA and actually only really knows about American high school from watching poorly translated episodes of Beverly Hills 90210. The writing in this game is stilted, cringey, and occasionally just bizarre. As of yet, I haven't heard anyone offer good reasons for this is not the case, but if you have some, id love to hear them."
Life is Strange,"So... This is OVERATED as fuck.<br/><br/>THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS <br/><br/>The characters are boring stereotypes of what a 40 year old french man thinks teens (millenials) are.<br/>Chloe, a grade A bitch. Max, boring and has no emotion.<br/>Villain, uninteresting, bland and came out of the bloom.
<br/>The background characters are bland and have no real weight on the story.<br/>The only character I was actually interested in was Kate Marshall, but she was completly toss to the back after, like, episode 3. <br/><br/>The dialog and dellivering, OMFG!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!<br/><br/>That's so fucking bad and cringy.
Just... omg...

<br/><br/>Contrary to most say, I actually like the art style and aesthetic of LiS, even if it looks iffy sometimes, mainly on close ups on the models faces. <br/><br/>The story...
As a LLLOOOOTTTT of plot holes, contrivances, paths that lead nowhere (I'm speaking to you Episode 4...), things that are left unexplained.<br/>Yet, I enjoyed it when I played for the first time.<br/>But the most I thought about it, the least I started disliking it. <br/><br/>The soundtrack, pretty darn good. As an art student I hear that type of music in my school and believe that fits the game's theme, characters, period and setting.
(I have the CD for LiS:BtS, and it is a banger) <br/><br/>The choices you make during the game are pretty much meaningless.<br/>If you want to play a game where you decisions really matter and change the story, go play Detroit: Become Human or early Telltale Games like The Wolf Among Us. <br/><br/>This game has a LOT of problems, yet I think it is a pretty good on time play game.<br/>Doesn't have that much replay value."
Life is Strange,"Until near the end of the ""game"" its a near unsufferable 90's teen drama projected into modern days.

<br/><br/>The last chapters big revelation dont save the title from the trainwreck ending and lack of real choices."
Life is Strange,"Pretty good game, I liked the plethora of characters and the big twist, decisions felt meaningful, definitely worth jumping into."
Life is Strange,"I bought this game for £5. I now realise it is worth so much more; how I missed this game for two years I don't know, I'm glad I finally got around to playing it; I haven't felt like this in a long time after playing a game, a completely lifechanging experience. 
<br/><br/>
Life is Strange is slightly similar to games of the Telltale series, your choices affect the outcome of the game and make subtle and huge changes throughout. You feel empathy for the characters in the world, and whilst handling mature themes such as depression, the game grips you to your seat. It is amazing! A masterpiece. The writers are on par with some of the best TV shows and films out there, it makes you question every choice you make, your own reality. As a player you actually feel like you affect the relationships between the characters.

<br/><br/>The music and art design are unique and aesthetically pleasing, which is a nice change from the usual games I play. The voice acting's brilliant, the lip synchronization is not so much, but it is not awful. 
Without spoiling anything, the twists in this game, WOW. I can see why this game has critical acclaim.

<br/><br/>Finally I must end saying how much I recommend this game. I've experienced nothing like it before, if you read this. Please try this game. You won't regret it."
Life is Strange,The only game to ever make me cry. Next to God of War one of the most emotional stories a game has ever told - a story that will stick with me forever.
Life is Strange,"<div>I'd call this game an interactive story in which you decide at certain points how the protagonist acts which in turn influences how the rest of the story plays out. The protagonist, a young girl that returns to her place of birth to attend academy. What makes her special and what the whole story revolves around is that she has somehow aquired the power to rewind time, coupled with a dream or view into the future which paints a dark future of destruction for her hometown, reminiscent of  the Upside Down from Stranger Things (this games does not have horror elements, however).</div><div><br/></div><div>What divides people over this game is the emotional reactions the game devs try to elicit from the player. The narrative revolves around the protagonists former childhood friend who at some point lost her father, became estranged from her mother and despises her mother's new boyfriend, lost the protagonist as her best and only friend when the protagonist moved away, found a new best friend which went missing shortly before the story begins, got into drugs and then got thrown out of college for that. The game begins with another tragic event happening to her and the game ultimately is about how the protagonist tries to fix things for her using her power and, but that depends on your choices, succeeds or fails at it.</div><div><br/></div><div>Some will find the game exceptional, some will not like it.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Very fitting OST, think two of the songs made it to my spotify lists.<br/></div>"
Life is Strange,"This game is the epidemy of atmospheric to me. The soundtrack, art design, color pallet, suburban location creates such a unique experience which I actually felt. From the moment Max put headphones in her ears and started to walk in the school hallway and Syd Matters - To All Of You starts to play, I knew I was in for a treat. Yes, the voice acting was strange at a times for some characters, lip synch was terrible, but it can't take from what the game has -  character and spirit."
Life is Strange,"I really wanted it to be good too. At least, I went into into assuming it would be a well-written, highly emotional tale about characters I love. Unfortunately I was mistaken. 
<br/><br/>
The story is fine. It kept me invested enough to keep sluggishly wading through the tepid mess that is the game. I'll admit that I admire the balls the writers had to (SPOILERS) make the ending render everything you do in the game completely pointless. But for a game that is meant to be focused on and is most praised for it's characters, they sure were the most annoying fucking hobgoblins on the face of the Earth. The protagonist is boring and explains everything she does to the player. Worse is her best friend, who everyone seems to love for some reason. She gets some of the worst lines I have ever heard in any game, which is saying something looking at the quality of writing in most games. It is painfully obvious throughout the entire 'experience' that the writers are some guys in their late 30's with no knowledge of how people under 20 speak. 
<br/><br/>
In terms of meaningful choices I rarely gave two shits as I didn't care about what happened to the characters. Any part that could be actually emotional is ruined by one of the characters involved saying something that sounds like a bot wrote it. I at least liked the part where you go into the alternate dimension and have to decide whether you should euthanize your best friend or not. It truly was emotional and showed the makers of the game really do have skill somewhere inside them. Unfortunately it isn't long until we are catapulted back into the shitty assbitch dimension we came from. 

<br/><br/>The gameplay is standard but a bit more than you'd get in another episodic game like The Walking Dead. I found the puzzles dull and uninspired, which was disappointing considering the possibilities of the player being able to literally rewind time. I had a good time in the short segment in the diner where you can talk to multiple people, discovering small tidbits of information that you can then manipulate them with after rewinding. This was much more exciting then the other times you must find information, which involves tediously going through the speech tree and rewinding for a good 15 minutes.

<br/><br/>The final good thing about the game I have to say is that the atmosphere was superb. This obviously goes hand-in-hand with the environments, which I loved. They took very simple places like a school or a dump, and visualized them in wonderfully unique ways, as well as filled them with small details to pour over. <br/><br/>

In short, in the 13 hours it took me to complete the game, about 1 hour altogether showed any true potential. Only buy it if you're an edgy fuck, (it's OK, we all had that stage) and/or LOVE meandering, pointless games. 

<br/><br/>(Also almost forgot to mention that it crashed on launch when I bought it, which took 2 hours of googling to fix)"
Life is Strange,"To me, this was a ""Meh"", but I can clearly see the potential here, so I'm giving it a Recommended instead. <br/><br/>Basically, I want you to try the game, and judge it for yourself.<br/><br/>Now, here are the issues I had with the game:<br/>Personally, I failed to relate to the characters around me. This caused me to just play the game for the gameplay. And if you ask anyone about TellTale's gameplay, they'll probably all agree that it is not the most exiting of things. <br/>I ended up getting stuck once, and managed to not understand the puzzle section.<br/><br/>Overall, I just felt like the game fell flat on every turn.<br/>Now, why do I want you to try this? - Because some of my friends love it.<br/><br/>to them, this tells an exiting story through direct means. They get to interact with the characters themselves and each choice feels true and meaningful.<br/><br/>Life is Strange is a weird one... :)"

Borderlands 2,"Borderlands 2 is a Game revered and hated by many. I have gained a lot of Experience through my Playing Time and have now come to your Conclusion to give my Opinion on this Masterpiece. It is quite clear Opinion On how to record this Game. First of all, I tell you something about the Story: The Story is weak but good in my Eyes.  You have a very good Villain Named Handsome Jack who tries to Kill or deceive you from the beginning. As a chamber Hunter who is out for and Success, one denies a Journey through the Pandora which has become a Victim of Exploitation. You always have something to do if they are Missions or you can explore new Areas. Sogut like any exceptional Opponent has a certain lootpool with special items such as Skin Adjustments or Legendarys.However, the Legendarys and rare items are difficult to get and take a lot of time to claim. So If you like to farm an Opponent for a long time in order to get something special, there will be a living out of your Activities and farms until the Doctor comes. You should definitely enjoy the Game with Friends Sun-Sonst it could get Boring after some Time as it is designed for coop and the Difficulty level with several by a lot Of Climbs and you can get better loot. You will be Later if you do not know how to levelt your char well or if you can simply use a real beginner is a good Supporter or a simple Fellow Player. To the Dlcs: The big story DLCS ARE all a nice extra to the actual Game. Especially the Tiny Tina dlc is with spacing the best, funniest and most beautiful dlc of all. It was Worth it to me to buy the Headhunter Packs even if they are not Worth Money to many. Convinced yourself and last but not least the Skin adjustments. They are clearly unnecessary and expensive. If you want them, it's best to wait for a Sale and hope until they're on Offer. There's also Op 8 where you can unlock more Difficulty levels in Ulitimate Vault Hunter Mode. The levelcap Dlcs are worthwhile if you want to level your Character further.  Just Convince yourself and try the Game! I hope I can help you a little bit. Your Evil"
Borderlands 2,"Craziest of all the Borderlands sequels. I know you haven't played this game from 2K, but that's why I'm writing this Borderlands 2 review to encourage you. You won't regret it if you continue reading!

Borderlands 2,"Overall: 7/10
<br/>Gameplay: 8/10
<br/>Story: 4/10
<br/>Music: 8/10
<br/><br/>Good game! Really fun mechanics with great replay value. Play it for that, though, not the story. They manage to leach just enough emotional impact out of the characters to make it worth finishing the story but not enough that it ever really hits home. Investing you more heavily in a few, more important NPCs that you develop a relationship with might have helped that. But then again, never what the game was trying to excel at. The outside lord (non-story) is decent, and sets a good atmosphere, but gets repetitive after a while. Similarly, the enemies you can fight, by the end, feel quite similar. If you’re playing right, there’s an optimal strategy for each PC, and once you have it down, you can just run through the game doing the same move set on most enemies. Even slagging becomes fairly irrelevant by late game, especially for big bosses. Their attempts to spice it up involve usually adding armor or resistance, or making a specific spot vulnerable. This adds more annoyance than strategy, however. Still, the actual “gun-feel,” if you will, is excellent, and it remains a great game especially in co-op. In fact, I’d say that’s where it shines, as playing with friends lends a whole new level of strategy to how you stack your skills and play styles together. Last thing, the gun generation system is great, BUT being able to progress with guns you like a lot (pay for an upgrade) would make it even better as there’s little to no incentive to do anything other than farm a few bosses until you get the best gun for your level and stick with it for a while until it simply is unusable. Overall, good game, great for it’s time, the story is lacking but still well worth a play through for the mechanics."
Borderlands 2,"Worst game I've EVER played from this company. The special powers absolutely suck, what's considered a ""trivial"" mission will have you killed no less than 5 times on average, and you cannot buy rocket launcher ammunition in most places. Overall it is absolute crap!!"
Borderlands 2,"fun game, but with a preteen's sense of humour. i'm personally not a fan of level-based combat, but that's forgiveable"
Borderlands 2,Replayed the 4k version of Borderlands 2. Borderlands 2 holds up well. The combat is still fluid and fun. The constant gun upgrades are very fun and I like the quests.<br/><br/>Final Score: A-

Half-Life 2,"Gordon Freeman? Gordon Freeman! 
How dangerous can a single Man with a Crowbar already be?
Gameplay ""Half-Life 2"" is arguably one of the most famous Shooters of the old School. Just like its Predecessor, it came with a revolutionary Engine that takes full advantage of the Game with clever Physics games and Physics Puzzles. In addition, in the second Part you can also Enjoy Steering vehicles and using environmental objects as a Weapon with the ""Gravitron"" cannon. Also in the third Run of this Classic I noticed how damn well the Levels were designed. These not only feel right in length and offer many little Secrets and Hiding Places, but always provide new Ways to really hurt the Enemies. However, the Levels are always designed in such a way that you can adapt to new Gameplay Mechanics and this provides a lot of Variety for a linear Shooter Like Half-Life. OK, you might be surprised why there are now 500 Saw blades lying around in this Cemetery but hey: Otherwise it's not fun!
Story ""Continue alone!"" – Barney Calhoun, Half-Life in 60 Seconds The Story is explained quite little, here is some not so important Information: After Gordon killed the Nihilanth (The Giant Baby) in the first Part, the Way was open for a new Enemy to reach the back up That was held off by the Xen dimension: The ""Combine."" As a Result, this invaded our Dimension, enslaved people and locked them together in Cities. Many former People from Black Mesa and others built on it a Resistance that Guides Gordon and helps him. Among Them, by the way, the ""Vortigaunts,"" the green Aliens from the first Part. Gordon himself was sent on the Journey by the mysterious G-Man after allegedly signing a Contract with Gordon at the End of the first Part. 
Actually, the Story in Half-Life is rather secondary, as you're just passing through Almost the entire Game. Still, it raises enough Questions to warrant a third Installment in the Franchise. 
Probably the more interesting Story is more about what triggered this Game. The source engine not only Allowed us games like ""Counter Strike: Global Offensive,"" ""Team Fortress,"" ""Left for Dead"" and ""Garry's Mod,"" but revolutionized Games, straight Shooters, Generally with new Ideas and Possibilities that you can also use in other Games Can find. In addition, ""Half-Life 2"" was the first Game to Play Only via Steam and developer Valve built on it, so that you can only enjoy being able to read this Review through the Game. The Bottom Line is that this Game is not only the Cornerstone for Steam, but also one of the biggest Milestones in Video Game history. Every Gamer knows the Term ""Half Life 3 confirmed,"" as many want a third Part, but it must be against fanatically high Demands.
Graphic/Sound It may be out of date, but that doesn't detract from the Game. Compared to its Predecessor, you could still say that a little more Variety comes into play through the different Levels. Soundtechnically, a lot has also been taken over from the first Part and there is nothing Special about it.
Verdict ""Half-Life 2,"" like its Predecessor, is a Milestone in the History of Video Games. That'S why you should have played it. But even otherwise it can still score today with its very good Level Design, as few Games can feature. Personally, I play the Game over and over again and it's a certain Constant that I keep dragging myself to the classic Shooters. I can absolutely recommend it and if you're already playing Games on Steam, why not the Game that Steam Made big?

I just can't write a Review of this Game without sharing this Video. A quick Summary of the two Half-Life Titles. Warning: Spoilers! 
Half-Life in 60 Seconds"
Half-Life 2,"Completed as of writing this review: Base Game.<br/><br/>Man, that is one heck of a revolution for the first-person shooter genre. Half-Life 2 is one of those legendary games that were technically impressive for their time. The gameplay was also fun and even addictive. However, there are some parts that were a little too complicated to figure out. Not a big problem though. I also would like to mention how good of a job Valve has done to make this game as immersive as possible. There were a lot of times when the scenery felt too real, and for 2004 that blows my mind to imagine what kind of a game that was. I'd suggest this game to everybody who is a fan of the genre, it is really a heck of a ride."
Half-Life 2,Played it for the first time in 2021. Can't believe a 15 year old 1st person shooter still holds up. You can expect old strategy based games or arcade games being addictive in today's times. But a first person shooter to do that is unreal. My favorite part about the game is how satisfying using the weapons feel like. Gravity Gun Ultra Pro Max!!!!
Half-Life 2,"The last generation of mankind is given a choice. To live in slavery or to fight and die free.

A post-soviet atmosphere so familiar to Eastern Europeans. A reference to the USSR and the totalitarian society inspired by the novel «1984»."
Half-Life 2,"I have clear memories of watching the E3 tech demos of this game over and over before it was released. Finally playing this game a few months later was heaven at the time. In retrospect, the game was revolutionary, but is held back by many of the same problems present in Half Life 1."
Half-Life 2,"Solid and well-produced, especially in terms of sound and lighting, but I end up agreeing a lot with the old Errant Signal video about this one: a bit too drawn out, weight-based physics puzzles wear out their welcome, and a story that simultaneously happens around Freeman while also flattering him around every corner. It's wild how well these games hold up graphically and stylistically, though."
Half-Life 2,"I played HL2 on a PS3 so I don't know if there's a big difference between the XBOX one so a big apology. Back to the game, I played it on a console a lot of years after its original release on PC but I can say that at least everything is said about HL2 is true, the game play, the music, the combat, the characters, the story, everything is in the right place, it works as an action FPS, as a survival horror or even as a puzzle game, the thing is that when you reach the end you don't notice and then the thing is over, I don't know if it's a masterpiece but is sure an amazing game, if you hadn't played you sure are missing something really good."
Half-Life 2,"This is THE best first person shooter ever released, period. And one of my most favorite soundtrack in video games. "
Half-Life 2,"In the age of flashy shooters like Borderlands 2, Doom 3 and Wolfenstein, Half-Life's innovative approach to level design and gameplay mechanics is not as fresh as it was back in 2004. The market has much to offer both in conventional and horror shooter subgenres. But then again, it's been 14 year and the impression HL2 left on game creators can be easily seen in modern shooters. <br/><br/>It's lore is huge and expands far beyond the game itself. Remember all the speculations surrounding the endings of each episode? I know you do!<br/>Also, who the hell is G-man? How come Gordon is the right man in the wrong place? What does the fate have in store for the characters?<br/>Please Valve. We need to know. <br/><br/>The legendary game is beautifully built, and has stood the test of time (and I am not talking about game mechanics or graphics). Gordon Freeman is still above Gordon Ramsey in Google top searched after all! The Source engine is used even today, many of the mod creators who built the communities around the game are now fullfledge gamedevs. What else could you ask of a game, that would someday be a history book material along with it's prequel and it's creators?<br/><br/>Once upon a time this game blew my mind. If by some miracle we ever see Half-Life 3 it will, unfortunately, fall short of all the hype surrounding it."

BioShock,"BioShock: Nostalgia meets Horror and the Mileage below the Ocean's Surface in a rundown 60S city. A Setting can't be more abstract, can it be? But then why is it so Popular? Ebend DARUM! In Bioshok you play Jack who Tumps into the Atlantic on a Plane and is the only Survivor to save himself to a Lighthouse, which takes him through an Elevator to the Underwater City of Rapture. Once There, a Cat and Mouse game for Life and Death begins. 
The gripping story in whose Point of Conflict is always the Question of what is true and how free is one in his Decisions in life. In the End, was I just been duped and a Slave without free Will? Bioshok is a Single-player First-person shooter set in a Cyberpunk universe with many religious Aspects and superhuman Powers. The Setting Of the Game has succeeded very well and the Atmosphere is Atmospheric in every respect. Although the Game occasionally gives us some Choices, the Game is relatively Linear, but always questions human Morality and ethical Decisions. In The beginning, the Game scores with Horror Factor, while in the End it gets more and more profound and sets the Horror back a bit. Mann butchers his way through the individual boroughs with a manageable but versatile, number of Weapons and Powers on the way to Ryan the Owner and Herscher of Rapture. Three different Ends, along with liquid Control, offer fun and Replay Value.
BioShock gets from me the following Rating: (5 Star system) Graphic: ★ ★ ★ (see (interface very successful graphics but Something to circus-like) Sound: ★ ★ ★ ★ (Completely setting) Features: ★ ★ ★ (Features and Level Design to Linear but Voiced)
Control: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ (Gamomad Control recommended!)
Fun: ★ ★ ★ ★ (Lasts for one to Two game rounds feast!)
Mood: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ (Incredibly good captured charm in the style of Al Capone/Noir movies of the 40gs-60s) Total: 81% (-1% for the crude Start and the subsidence of Horror) Private Fait: A Solide Game that hasn't kept me on the Pole forever, but a Game I Probably unpack again every few Years to see maybe the Last End. Although I often have a Clue in which Direction a Game is developing, the Mind ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ towards the End when meeting Ryan was also Violent for Me this time. That'S why I will always remember Bioshok as a Game that inspired me to think about the one in The Game 3 days at a time. While most Fans are Of the Opinion that the BioShok Infinite Ending that Brain ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ending was bad for me, for me this One was far too predictable and Bioshok 1 will always have in my opinion the remembered ""End"" (This is not the direct End but the End of R yan).

BioShock,"Objectivism is another desire to understand the world around us with our minds.<br/><br/>Another idea to create a utopia, but this time away from people and in an exotic place. All such ideas descend into etatism and totalitarianism. Especially if it is a backwater city, from which it is not as easy to escape as it is to enter.<br/><br/>This bright idea based on a libertarian model of society has fallen because of an insane leader and one smuggler. The struggle for power and self-interest led to the collapse of society.<br/><br/>Overall the game is very deep (I don't mean ocean), and brings out a lot of philosophical ideas. And of course the steampunk stylistics combined with the 50's era are just awesome to look at."
BioShock,"Overall: 8/10<br/>Gameplay: 8/10 (Would have been 9.5/10 at the time it came out, but has since aged out of its prime and the later games in the series do the same mechanics but better.)<br/>Story: 8/10<br/>Music: 9/10<br/><br/>More detailed review to come. (WIP)"
BioShock,"You can't play this game, and say it could've been better. Nothing will top this game, it'll go down in history as the best of all time in all aspects. It's perfect"
BioShock,"An immersive sim that just happens to be a great FPS. The environmental storytelling alone in this game makes it worth your time, but the interesting gameplay elements and encounter design really elevate it to another level. The sole problem with this game are the NPC character models, which are just unintentionally frightening. A game I wish I could forget so I could replay it with a fresh mind."
BioShock,"BioShock takes the player to the underwater utopia of Rapture, where genetic modifications have driven most of the city's population mad. These modifications come in the form of ""plasmids"" - a series of injectables allowing human beings to strengthen themselves or acquire new abilities. These plasmids not only exists in the lore but also the gameplay, allowing players to use the plasmids to perform various, unique abilities, such as setting enemies on fire or using telekineses to throw nearby objects at them. This makes the gameplay very varied, and often more engaging than the average FPS.

<br/><br/>Other than the plasmids, the player of course also gets access to an arsenal of firearms, everything from a revolver to a crossbow. Combining the use of firepower with the plasmids feels very satisfying, and offers the player control of the battle in ways that very few games do. While the gunplay might not be the most advanced, the simplicity of it has it's charm.

<br/><br/>Then there's the story. It's simply one of the best video game stories I've ever experienced. It's also very unpredictable, mainly because of the many twists and turns. I, of course, won't spoil anything, as I feel you should experience it for yourself. The story of Rapture is mainly told to the player through audio logs found throughout the city, giving the player more insight into how Rapture ended up how it did. The level of environmental storytelling in the game is impressive, and this is further improved by the great graphics, for a 2007 game at least.

<br/><br/>I can not recommend BioShock enough. Whether you're looking for an interesting main story which questions the way our society works, or simply a unique shooter game, this is the game you're looking for.

<br/><br/>Overall Score: 10/10 - Exceptional
<br/>+ Mind-bending main story<br/>+ An unique FPS experience
<br/>+ Immersive environments"
BioShock,"Bioshock is one of those games that is so good that it overflows from gaming culture into regular pop culture. So even though I'm late to play it, I've seen references to it for over a decade now.  The final third is a bit too repetitive, but overall the game is beautifully crafted in every way and the art deco aesthetic makes it a memorable playing experience."
BioShock,"First time playing through and it was just as good as everyone said it was going to be. The gameplay is fun and engaging, but my only complaint would be that at times it felt a little dated. It covers a lot of bases and it juggles all these different mechanics and accommodates for different play styles. In a lesser game that would be a problem, but Bioshock manages to execute this extremely well. But by today's standards I've like played good shooters that have managed to have better roleplaying elements or more tense and claustrophobic horror sections. So my experience as the player ended up feeling kind of middle of the road. I was never as scared as I wanted to be or as hyped for gun combat as I've been in other games. But Bioshock is still great and I would recommend to anyone who hasn't played it yet. "
BioShock,One of the best settings. One of the best atmospheres in video games and one of the best OST. No need for more words... 
BioShock,"Well, I know that everybody loves this game but it seems overrated for me. Too many useless weapons and repetitive mechanics. And what do you need a crossbow for? It seems that I just don’t get this game. It’s too focused of technics for me, I guess.  "
BioShock,"Don’t wait if you haven’t played this game yet! A very enjoyable gameplay, an incredible setting, a unique story and wonderful visuals. You’ll love the characters and will really empathize them. The combat system here is never boring, with multiple weapons and fighting skills. Though the game is 10 years old now, it’s still and awesome title.  "
BioShock,Would you kindly just play this game and take the general public's word about how great this game/series is?
BioShock,Amazing!

Limbo,"Otherwise, I'm not a fan of computer games at all, I just bought it because more than a hundred positive reviews made me curious.
To make it short: I was totally stunned by the design - on the one hand spooky and dark, one recognizes almost nothing; on the other hand also very detail-loving in all movements and animations.
It was not always easy to crack the challenges - confess to looking into a movie here and there - but it really got me.
The only critical point: I know, in FPS things are quite different, but a little less cruelty would have been good. I took care that my 8-year-old son, who was very interested because his father was sitting in front of a game, did not hear too much about it. Mordende spiders, Spiee, Kreissgen, Stromschlge etc. would have brought him bad dreams.
Regardless, but a really cool thrill."
Limbo,"This game is one of a kind. A gothic graphic without paying attention to frills, made in such a way that the player concentrates on the child protagonist of the game. Many parts of the game are very complicated, and you will have to die quite a few times before passing certain steps in the game. There are no dialogues, a perfect choice in my opinion, the essential and concise plot, the child on his sister's journey and ventures into limbo where all kinds of deadly traps and traps await him. I want to congratulate Playdead for this title, I had played sporadically on IOS without ever going beyond the first few levels, but I liked the game immediately for its minimal graphics and moderate difficulty. The 5 stars are a must. Given the excellent reviews of other users and the success it has received, I hope Playdead will give us a sequel or another game of this kind, it would be great!"
Limbo,"Super game, super - and especially dstere - graphics, not too heavy, not too light. That would be the very short summary. The boy can run and jump, otherwise there is an action button with which you can move boxes, for example, or adjust levers. These actions are also a major part of the game, so you do not have to survive all the opponents like a classic Jump n Run to reach the end of a level, but rather constantly think about how to overcome a seemingly unmanageable obstacle by skillfully combining all the resources but can overcome. If this does not work, you die - but you must not be too squeamish, rolling heads and loud splashing (black and white) blood should be abknnen. Otherwise, a failure is not bad, you can just start another start, limited ""life"" or something similar does not exist. Therefore, the game is also ideal for casual players, because you can always stop, and the next time just continue where you left off. 5 stars without ifs and buts, at the price already three times."
Limbo,"Journal Style Review:<br/><br/>Good opening. Clearly the prequel to inside which I really liked. <br/><br/>Beat it. Enjoyed it. The puzzles were quite clever. Only once did I google a solution because I was stuck and getting frustrated. The style was nice. I do think Inside improves upon the game in pretty much every aspect from art style to puzzle quality, but this was still a short and sweet game that I enjoyed.<br/><br/>Finals Score: B+"
Limbo,very nice game with a dark atmosphere highly recommended for players who like dark games.<br/> 
Limbo,"Limb + Bardo = Limbo.<br/><br/>«An intermediate stage between one phenomenon and another».<br/><br/>Infinity and cyclicality. These feelings were with me throughout the game. The boy's determination and courage instilled hope and interest throughout the adventure. It seemed like this game would never end, and when the end came, it felt like my journey was starting all over again.<br/><br/>Thanks «Playdead» for taking the platformer to a new level and giving birth to the art house video game genre."
Limbo,"<div>I'd like it more if it was a bit lenient on the perfect movement. Timing has to be to perfect to go through and It frustrated me a lot. The art is superb though the game play style is too slow and I don't like this kind of puzzle solving.  <br/></div><div>Can play once I guess.  Not for me, I just finished just for the sake of finishing it it, I would have dropped it midway otherwise.<br/></div>"
Limbo,"Great game, although gameplay becomes a bit repetative near the end (game is short so it doesn't get repetative for long). Never the less, defenitely a must play for anyone who enjoys a beautifull artstyle, abstract storytelling and puzzles."
Limbo,"This game holds up well with time. The art direction creates an eerie atmosphere. The puzzles themselves can be very challenging. I had to resort to using an online guide for a number of obstacles. The beauty of this game is that the world is so rich, but it is also easy to pick up and put down and still have a rewarding gaming experience."
Limbo,"Wow, just wow... what a way to welcome me to the modern puzzle platformer genre.
<br/><br/>Limbo is one of those games where revealing too much about it could ruin the fun and appeal of it. Interestingly enough, Arnt Jensen (creator of the game) takes the same approach... he doesn't reveal too much of anything in the game, where it would rob it of its intrigue. You wake up in a forest as a boy, not knowing who you are, what your name is, and what your task entails. It's up to you to piece the elements together and embark on a journey that plays on your own personal, imaginative mind.
<br/><br/>With a simple but effective shadow/light setting, the ambiance of the game is eerily dark and astonishingly enigmatic. It grips you by the jugular and forces you to submit to its visual authority. The art style is reminiscent of Tim Burton's shadowy netherworld trademark material, a wise choice that really compliments the mood of the game. Music is non-existent. The audio is placed at the forefront, with an amplified emphasis on your surroundings. Turn your sound up as high as possible to soak it all in... you're welcome.
<br/><br/>Limbo is filled with various puzzles, some more challenging than others. Admittedly, I had a few moments where the solution was in 'broad daylight'... but I took the liberty to overthink it in so many ways, wreaking my brain cells in the process. I literally created problems for myself that weren't even there to begin with, a testament to the ingenuity of the puzzle designs.

In other cases, I had to shut the game off and move on to something else (with the answer unexpectedly arriving in my head much later, during a drive to Chipotle, of all places). My love for expletives were repeatedly thrown at the screen, stemming from an infuriated sense of frustration with not knowing how to solve the later puzzles. However, I did manage to solve all of them on my own... well, save for one. I resorted to YouTube for it and and thought ""Man, I wouldn't have never figured that one out.""
<br/><br/>The beauty in Limbo is dying endlessly (Yeah, you read that right). Being able to learn from trial/error and familiarizing yourself with the mechanics of the world is a must. Sure... it breaks the flow of the game, but nothing feels more satisfying than eventually overcoming a puzzle that remarkably stumped you for 45 minutes to an hour.
<br/><br/>All in all, a short but engrossing game that rewards you with unwavering amounts of patience and persistence. While it may disappoint some with its minimalist narrative decision, I thought it excelled in this regard. It unabashedly caters to a variety of interpretations and theories, making it that much more interesting and memorable long after you’ve finished it."
Limbo,"Limbo is an adventure, platformer. Limbo is in black and white. I like playing Limbo when someone is watching, or play in the evening to calm myself. The game might also get you scared or frustrated a bit. Stay cautious!"
Limbo,"Tonally, this is exactly what I love from dark and grim games. For the first playthrough the pacing is damn near perfect, too. The problem comes with subsequent playthroughs, which are not nearly as compelling. Moments of tension work great the first time, but mostly feel like a slow down if you play it over again. "
Limbo,"Don’t deserve its money on the full price. However, if you want some good spooky puzzler and a few bucks to spend, go try it. Limbo is full of interesting puzzles and it looks great. Nothing really innovative here but not everybody thinks new is always better. So I guess, all puzzle and horror lovers will enjoy Limbo. "
Limbo,"This game looks awesome but that’s it. Instead of a cool indie puzzler I’ve got something close to an old school platformer that is impossible to play. I died too much to enjoy it. But I don’t think the devs wanted the game was so hard. Maybe, something just went wrong, I don’t know. Anyway, as for me, Limbo doesn’t deserve all this fascination it gets. The game is too intellectual, so better skip it.  "
Limbo,"I know people love this game and that's great. But for me, I found it a bit slow and a bit boring. I just don't really get the hype surrounding this game... I can't find anything particularly clever, challenging or interesting in regards to its story or game mechanics."
Limbo,"Mi reseña: (spanish): <a href=""http://www.ruraltex.org/2012/06/la-otra-dimension-no-solo-de-discos.html#limbo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruraltex.org/2012/06/la-otra-dimension-no-solo-de-discos.html#limbo</a>"

Limbo,Absolutely amazing! Literally loved the game and story so much!
Limbo,"Tried 3 times, but never was close to the end. Boring."
God of War (2018),"Awesome game. Played on PC. Maxed out graphics. Story, voice acting, pace is fantastic! Not too repetitive. Really personifies a grandiose feeling."
God of War (2018),"The game is good. But is this God of War?<br/><br/>Well, the first time I played, I ended up quitting. Why? Because I found it boring. The hype and self-pretentiousness kinda ruined the experience for me. This time was different. My friend let me his Playstation 4. I played every main GoW and loved it, especially the third one. After that, naturally, I was curious about how Kratos would end up there and why. I also had sympathy for Kratos, which I didn't have before. I'm trying to say that GoW 2018 does not sustain itself alone. If you never heard about Kratos and has a good repertory of movies/book with similar Dad and Son Plot, It will not be enough to grab your attention.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I believe the game lost its soul. Yeah, they are trying to tell a new story - and I appreciate that. The problem is a major mischaracterization in-game. The point of view is a nice example of that. Sacrifice the gameplay in favor of the narrative was not a good idea when the script is not that good, like Last of Us, and the melee gameplay was going to get worse. And I say more, the RPG system here is weak as hell. What can I say more? well... mediocre dialog and a static story ""progression"" made me get angry sometimes.<br/><br/>But... I still recommend this game. The story is still interesting if you played the previous games. The gameplay is not dynamic, but fun sometimes. The dialog is not great but has its moments, especially when Kratos reflects on his past. The graphics were amazing, as was its optimization. 4K 40 fps looked amazing. There is much to talk about - good and bad things, but I'm sleepy. Happily, most of its problems were corrected in Ragnarok, so it's worth your time."
God of War (2018),"couldnt finish. the change of camera made the combat unfun and unresponding and slow, mb it s look good but doesnt play good. i prefer the first over this one regarding gameplay. Also boring exposition and story look a 2010s game"
God of War (2018),"Besides a couple of nitpicks here and there, I can't think of an open-world game that wasn't just jampacked with fluff but instead, for the most part, had engaging side quests &amp; end game challenges that fit gameplay and story-wise!<br/><br/>Played on the second hardest difficulty but managed to get the platinum after dying so many times starting out! "
God of War (2018),"Actually came into this one with concern. There was so much hype that I thought it was just going to let me down. But it did not! The absolute beauty of the game is something to see, with a truly engaging story.  Only thing I would knock against it is Niflhiem…that was way too repetitive and unnecessary. "
God of War (2018),"Loved this more than I expected to. Incredibly cool world, story, enemies, and filled to the brim with bosses. Normally I’m wary and anxious to fight larger enemies but in this game I loved the larger challenges, learning how to approach them and what attacks to use until it became almost second nature how to defeat their moveset. The amount of character development is also very impressive. The way Kratos is made to be an extremely harsh, aggressive father left me with so much joy anytime he gave a shred of kindness to Atreus, and eventually he becomes a better, more wholesome father who faces his life and chooses to be better. You can acknowledge your past and change, even if the path you walk is still soaked in blood."
God of War (2018),"Ahhhh I really wanted to like this more than I did. I enjoyed the experience, but I never felt connected with the story which sucks because people loved it. I really enjoyed the combat, but found the gameplay to get a bit tedious when I entertained even some side-quests and there's so much more until I 100% it. I also had issues with frame rate holding steady despite being on a PS4 Pro.

Excellent game, but I didn't connect with it in the way others may have."
God of War (2018),The story and visuals were out of the world. I played the story level difficulty but still liked the combat. maybe will try playing on normal next time. the sound track was great and the axe throw and getting back was a great experience. This is a great game.
God of War (2018),"Just think that soft-reboot of the series that never interests me before will find itself in the dying genre of 3d-metroidvania, which I adore so much."
God of War (2018),"Pretty darn good. Gameplay is enjoyable and challenging, has depth. The world and story/characters could feel a little more natural but overall it's solid."
God of War (2018),"God of War presents an unexpected and heart-warming story in the midst of gore and action. The combat is exciting and flashy, but where the game lacks is the in-between. The puzzles are uninteresting and getting from location to location feels lack luster and boring. But when you're not solving arbitrary puzzles or slogging to locations, the story is epic, the emotions are heavy, and the combat is brutal. "
God of War (2018),"The game is beautiful in visuals, graphics, cinematographic performance... The experience feels like watching an excellent movie. It is so good of a movie that it's not so good as a game. Gameplay feels tight and I spent too much time watching cinematics instead of actually fighting. Or solving puzzles instead of smashing heads and guts."
God of War (2018),"The visual art is amazing, the story is really enjoyable and it's easy to play. All you can demand in a videogame."
God of War (2018),"9/10 <br/><br/>I love the world they built, all its characters and how the story is told. I am sorry that the game at times becomes very repetitive, there is not a lot of variety of bosses and enemies and this goes against the ideology that I had of this game and all the other god of war games. Regarding gamepley this is most likely one of the best games I have ever played."
God of War (2018),"Pre Ragnarok Replay:<br/><br/>Fuck ya just bought a PS5 in preparation for Ragnarok. Giving God of War a second play through before it comes out.<br/><br/>It’s just as good as I remembered. I was “worried” that my memory of this game was overhyped but nope, it’s fucking sweet.<br/><br/>It’s so fucking sweet. <br/><br/>It’s so so fucking sweet.<br/><br/>Moody Atraius isn’t my favourite part. It fits the story but the “whatevers” are starting to piss me off boy. Plus shoot arrows when I tell you to damn it.<br/><br/>Beat the journey. Loved it but I don’t want to overdo it before Ragnarok so I’m calling it. Maybe I come back someday to beat the final side quests and valkyries. There’s potential I come back for the platinum but probably not till after Ragnarok, which means I probably won’t ever do it. Unreal game.<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/><br/>Too kick off this review I have to mention the opening boss fight. That fight went on forever in the best way possible. It lets you know right from the get go that this game is going to be special. God of War has potentially the most satisfying combat ever. It looks, sounds, and feels fantastic. The variety in combat moves and abilities is impressive because it does it in a way where it isn’t too difficult to remember how to do it all. It is a case of easy to pick up but difficult to master. God of War also had a surprisingly interesting Jo story which I did not expect.<br/><br/>One minor criticism is the lack of enemy variety. This criticism is minor because every enemy that they do have in the game is so well done and the combat is so well done that I didn’t really notice until the end of the game. But when you actually think about it in the end there are not that many. Nonetheless this game will go down as a top tier of this generation.<br/><br/>Final Score: A+"
God of War (2018),"<div>Fun moment to moment game play is rarely joined by both stunning visuals and a beautifully realized narrative to this level. God of War is one of those exceptions. Battling monsters from realm to realm starts off fun and just gets better and better as time goes on. 
Just as much positive can be said for the story as well. The tale of father and son has enough twists and turns to keep you dying to see more and each pay off is better than the last. God of War has some incredible gaming moments that will be talked about for years. 
If my only complaint is I want more, then I just played a very good game.</div><div>5/5<br/></div>"

Those aren't usually things I think about when I'm playing an action game so it speaks to how well the universe of this game was made. The combat is so smooth with it's animations that any frame of the action could be used as promotional material and the feeling of the clashes, especially the boomerang-esque leviathan axe when it's being recalled, are the best seen in any game up to this point. The game feels like it re-invents almost nothing, yet perfects so many systems from so many other games, both in it's core combat gameplay loop as well as its world exploration. Easily one of the great video games. "
God of War (2018),"4.5!!! i love how the story evolved from what the original series was into what it is now i love the direction its gone and i love love love love atreus. and i thought the juxtaposition between freya's parenting decisions vs kratos' was really interesting it was really well thought out neither was inherently good or bad both flawed.
"
God of War (2018),"beautiful and enveloping world supplemented with a great story that links the ones of the prior games in the best ways. combat is pretty good with a diverse moveset of abilities and attack methods, but can become formulaic after a little while once you know what's efficient, which becomes apparent in the late game. lots of uninteresting bosses used ad nauseum, intrusively tacked-on RPG elements that dont make sense, and zero replayability from the endless ""moviegame"" moments and tedious half-baked environmental 'puzzles' that would be a slog to get through again. also kratos takes up like half the screen. youll love it the first time and never play it again."
God of War (2018),"Story: 10/10 - Enjoyed it a lot. Loved the shift to norse mythology and the way the story played out. I found the pacing to be very good. There are a couple of moments, where the game purposefully slows the player down for some forced walking segments, which I personally dislike, but it wasn't to big of a deal here. The ending could have been a bit more climactic and the end boss could have been more spectacular (as you would expect from the series), but that's just me. <br/><br/>Combat: 6/10 - Serves its purpose, but it's a step back from the older GoW titles in my opinion. Still, throwing the axe and calling it back is fun (until the novelty wears off at least).  Also they re-used the same mini boss (troll) about 9 times, which was a bit annoying, even though the enemy had a different twist to it's move set in every encounter, it got pretty old, pretty fast. In general enemy variety wasn't great, but that mini-boss was the only one that really rubbed me the wrong way.<br/><br/>Exploration: 5/10 - Kratos' movement is very limited, as are the areas he can actually reach. This may not be too  noticeable while playing through the story, but it gets extremely annoying when backtracking and looking for collectibles.<br/><br/>Graphics: 10/10 - Absolutely amazing. The visual fidelity is probably the strongest I've seen yet. Environments are beautiful and the characters look amazing and animate very well.<br/><br/>Sound: 10/10 - The soundtrack and the sound design as well as the voice acting are on point. <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed my first playthrough of God of War. As soon as I started collecting things and backtracking a lot for the platinum trophy though, the flaws in its gameplay became very noticable. Still highly recommended, if only for the first playthrough experience."
God of War (2018),"9/10
 <br/><br/>+ Very smart reinvention of stale franchise 
<br/>+ Fantastic character performances (esp. Kratos) 
<br/>+ Excellent touching/beautiful story 
<br/>+ Combat is thrilling + challenging, never grew boring 
<br/>+ Top notch visuals, environments are gorgeous 
<br/>+ Way more to do than expected, meaty game 
<br/>+ Soundtrack stood out (esp vocal pieces) 
<br/>+ Norse mythology much more untapped than Greek 

<br/><br/>- Equipment customization too complicated, doesn't add much 
<br/>- Camera too tight"
God of War (2018),"As of 2018, my favourite game of all time. The story moved me in ways no other piece of media ever has, and the performances captured genuinely left me in awe. The no-cuts camera is groundbreaking and provides a relatable lens to view the story through - it makes you feel like you're on this adventure. This game moved me, and I will never forget the journey it took me on. God of War deserves to go down in history as one of the best offerings of the games industry."
God of War (2018),"I fucked up with this game. I did NOT want this game to be spoiled for me at all and I was also very busy in the months of April and May, combining to make this a game that I really tried blasting through. I did no side missions, didn't explore the customization options even close to their fullest, and I came across maybe one Valkyrie that I don't even think I beat. Really looking forward to giving this game another go NG+ style some time next year. From what I DID play though, this is one of the best games of the generation, and hands down the best game of the year (sorry red dead ur too realistic not very fun). The way this game FEELS is incredible, it reminded me of my first time playing any of the Arkham games and quickly getting used to that new style of combat. God of War takes those mechanics, adds an axe, makes it deeper, and RUNS with it. The combat in this game is beyond satisfying, and the mid-game reveal of getting the hell-blades that ALSO control incredibly was just the cherry on top of the tastiest pie I've ever had. They even managed to make rowing a boat feel good and natural, which when accompanied by Mimir's voice acting and stories makes me wanna stay in the boat until I'm decaying. This game also manages it's difficulty so well, I played on normal difficulty and always felt like I was earning every kill. The boss fights are hard, the Valkyrie fight is insane (can't even imagine trying to fight the final one, nervous), and FUCK the werewolf guys. And god, the graphics... the graphics... 2018 really spoiled us with Spider-Man, Forza 4, Red Dead, and this. I couldn't believe my eyes, Sony please for the love of god make a PS4 Pro that's on par with the Xbox One X, or please make the PS5 as good as the Xbox 2 or whatever awful thing they name it, I need to see God of War in the best way possible. This is my game of the year and my game of the generation so far, I can't wait to play it again and hopefully get the platinum."
God of War (2018),"More like an 8.5, this game is a well-packaged adventure, is like an Alfonso Cuaron movie where the camera doesn't stop following you, an amazing feat. The thing is that the simple but satisfying combat of the previous games is gone in favor of ""telling a story"" and sure looks cool if you're not actually playing it but I didn't like that you have a visual cue like in Assassins Creed to tell you when an attack is going to hit you, I was looking to that spot and not the whole screen. As for the story is an interesting one, and still feels like a God of War one, it excels in the character department, almost everyone is so remarkable, well acted and well scripted, everyone except for that ""boy"", is just an exposition device but an annoying one, I didn't buy that this kid grew in the wild, feels more like a spoiled suburban brat and also for the most part his relationship with Kratos feels too artificial, and speaking of Kratos he's still an amazing and cool character. In the end even the repetitive combat, the repetitive enemies (I think there's like only 3 unique boss fights in the game, everything else is just reskinned enemies), the annoying kid, etc, didn't stop me for finishing this game, is a fun ride but is way too far to be a masterpiece."

God of War (2018),"""First the moon and the stars will be lost in a dense white fog. Then the rivers and the lakes and the sea will freeze over. And finally, a wolf named Skoll will open his jaws and eat the sun, sending the world into an everlasting night. I think I hear the wolf at the door. ""<br/><div><br/></div><div>""BOY ... you sure are missing out if you don't play this game."" So, I'll admit, I never enjoyed the other GoW games. There was just something missing from them for me. This new entry into the series hits just about every nail on the head. You've got interesting characters, Atreus isn't useless like most NPC companions, game looks great on standard PS4 though at some parts I did get very noticeable frame rate drops, great soundtrack and some good boss fights too.</div><br/>One thing I didn't like about the game was the bosses that were essentially just re-skins of others with little to no variation in  move sets.<br/><br/>All in all, this game has set the bar high, I can't wait to see what comes next. 9.5/10 "
God of War (2018),"Nathan Drake goes berserk on Scandinavian mythology setting. And it's great!<br/><br/>Actually, GOW is something between «Exceptional» and «Recommended» for me. Sometimes it's strongly reminds you, that it's only a game, like when you have that plastic level limitations or your son tells you: «Let's explore the world, dad!». Аnd you are like: «How long should we hang around with your dead mother's ash in a sac, kiddo?». And gnomes. Brok and Sindri looks like the most powerful creatures in a game with their invisibility skill, hundred of workshops around the world and ability to improve weapons with one hammer blow.<br/><br/>But still it's a good story and you could rarely find such a narrative about relationship between a father and a son. It's closer to Last of Us more then Witcher3. And good story shouldn't necessarily be epic and large-scale.<br/><br/>Combat system is balanced and spicy. Never ever it was so funny to chop and cleave your opponents. From that point, remember dry and stingy Dark Souls or Bloodborne. Witcher3 was bloody and about razor-sharp skills of trained monster-assassin, but God of War gives you real rage. One thing I missed, to be honest, is «16+» mode and gore."

God of War (2018),"Frankly, I didn't like previous GOW games. They were a bit boring and absolutely self repetative with no new mechanics in sequels. But God of War 2018 became one of my favourite games in few hours. It's a real masterpiece. I am waiting for the sequel"
God of War (2018),"The new God of War is an amazing new take on the series. And while some of the fans might miss the old slasher gameplay mechanics with tons of enemies and huge monsters to slay, the new GoW manages to prove that the shift to this new camera and limited set of weapons was a right thing to do.<br/><br/>From the world that feels huge (like, physically huge), zero-cuts story and a great ""father and son"" dynamic, to the amazing new weapon that can be played in any imaginable way to fit your playstyle - the new GoW is a must-play if you ask me.<br/><br/>And one final note - this is a rare game that leaves so much content to be explored after beating the main story, that you want to come back again and again. If you go only through the main plot - you'll only see ~60% of the game. You won't even visit some of the ""biomes"" which is a pretty bold move, and I respect the developers for doing that."
God of War (2018),"Everything I love in a game! Anyone who has followed Kratos through his journey will certainly feel euphoric while playing this. Looks stunning and the gameplay is very pleasant. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, even if you have no idea who Kratos is, this is an experience you should take. And once you're finished with this, do yourself a favor and play the other GoW games, you'll be glad you did! ;)<br/><div class=""editor__insertion""><div><img src=""https://media.rawg.io/media/user_images/c3f/c3f0c3ce4ea8da360061fb2323ecc8d7.jpg""/></div></div>"
God of War (2018),"A strange mix of The Last of Us and Dark Souls with annoying QTEs. Was it so necessary to add this mechanics? The game is still fun without much depth in the gameplay but this FoV is quite frustrating. It’s not comfortable! Didn’t your testers notice that? 
However, the game’s visuals are awesome. Maybe you can find better looking titles today but the cinematic and the graphics in God of War are definitely one of the best on the market currently. And thanks for the Blades of Chaos - it’s nice to see them again. 
"
God of War (2018),"Well, nothing new here. I don’t understand why everybody loves this game - the game design and the story are not really that good. Disappointed."
God of War (2018),"Let’s be honest, it’s not God of War. They changed almost everything from the gameplay and the combat system to Kratos himself. He became a daddy that immediately ruined all his image of a brutal bloody warrior. Yes, the visuals are great but I won’t rate the game 9 or 10 just because of them. Better play Yakuza 6 or wait for E3 2018 to find something better than this. "
God of War (2018),"10/10. Every aspect of the game is perfect, especially I love the axe throwing animation. Whoever created this - dude, you raised the gameplay on a whole new level! The combat now is much better and never boring and repetitive. I guess, this game will be a benchmark for other developers. "
God of War (2018),"This game is even better than I expected. The story is deep, the combat feels amazing and all this is supported by outstanding graphics. Enjoyed the game from start to finish. "

Destiny 2,"Let me set this straight: This game is fantastic - don't let this review take anything away from that. The set design is jaw-dropping, the gunplay is satisfying and clean, the music is fantastic, and I can keep playing this for eternity.

However, with all that said. I still cannot recommend this game. Whilst it is incredible, the new player experience NEEDS to be revised, as it will be with Lightfall. When Lightfall arrives, I will come back and revise my review and maybe change it if the new player experience is properly fixed."
Destiny 2,"BRO seriously why are you playing shooters? And more importantly why are you mindlessly grinding a shooter, go play skylanders. 3/10"
Destiny 2,"This isn't a game.<br/><br/>This is a Skinner box. It's designed by sociopaths who don't even like playing games, specifically to play with how much they can manipulate people into playing this shit endlessly.<br/><br/><div>If you've ever played any other MMO, it will become immediately obvious that your ability to ever get any kind of loot worth having is going to be gated first by RNG, and then by other players. This may sound familiar, but the degree to which it's taken in this game is absurd, and the community, as a whole, couldn't be more toxic and n00b-hostile if it were required by law.</div><div><br/></div><div>PVP, in particular, is absolutely not even worth considering at this point unless you've been playing since launch. The way Bungo makes droprates suck complete shit paired with how they've removed the ability to even get a ton of old weapons means that no matter what you do, if you start playing right now, you'll never catch up with people who have been playing since launch.<br/><br/>And that's to say nothing about how before you can even think about going into PVP, you're likely as not to discover if you do some research that you're going to want to go in there as Stasis, which means both that you have to pay for Beyond Light AND that you better get comfy, because in order to get the Stasis subclasses, you have to play through the whole campaign ON EACH CHARACTER, and then spend weeks grinding out bounties with Elsie before they're actually worth using.<br/><br/>And even once you do all that? If you don't instantly prove that you're the best to ever play this game, you'll be relegated to shit-tier ELO, where you'll exclusively be used as easy pickings for players you're never going to be able to beat. Sweat all you want. Tell yourself you just need to ""git gud."" Believe that you'll get better.<br/><br/>None of that will make a difference.<br/><br/>Particularly in Trials of Osiris, don't get suckered in by the fact that you can solo queue; that shit is only there to bait you in to get slaughtered by the players Bungo actually cares about.<br/></div><div><div class=""editor__insertion""><div><img src=""https://media.rawg.io/media/user_images/c0b/c0b1549a83f91693bbbdfa2e6eb66d0e.png""/></div></div>If you don't show up to this game with at least 5 other people and an insatiable hunger to exchange money for cosmetic shit, Bungo doesn't give a flying fuck about you. <br/></div><div><br/></div><div>

Destiny 2,"I've decided to quit this game.<br/><br/>(A d33p reflection on this game and how video games pair with real life as a whole.)<br/><br/>writing this review real quick and procrastinating schoolwork in the process....<br/><br/>Part 1: Destiny 2 review<br/><br/>I started back playing in February after stopping in early D2, and I enjoyed catching up with everything, raiding regularly with the boys etc. However, since I've started back at school I've finally accepted that this game just isn't compatible with my life. And I just don't think it's compatible with real life in general.<br/><br/>Definitely some people might be able to come and go freely from this game and don't care that much about keeping up with it, but I have always been hooked by Destiny. Hell, this game has been a part of my life for almost a third of my existence (although i did quit it like this on 2 occasions). <br/><br/>This realization was brought on by farming strikes for the current season's ritual weapon. Since the start of the new season (and school for me), I've played maybe an hour a week, only doing the ""new"" content. But yesterday I went down a youtube rabbithole and got the idea to grind out the ritual weapon and try some new builds along the way. <br/><br/>Let me just say that any game that incentivizes you to play the same exact levels OVER AND OVER AGAIN is not worth your time (I was speedrunning Lake of Shadows, which is probably as repetitive as content can possibly get. I could've been doing nightfalls but i didn't feel like it and, despite the extra rewards, playing content like That repetitively is Also not worth your time.)<br/><br/>I realized that I'm not playing this game because I actually enjoy playing it aka the act of gameplay and playing through missions. I'm only playing it because of the carrot on the stick at the end of it. I mean, I've known this game was pointless forever now, but I'm having a particularly strong reaction to it now. <br/><br/>The design and environments are pretty damn nice. The universe is pretty large scale and decently interesting even if the plots of the game have been extremely mediocre. These are two big appeals of a game to me. But I realized I'm only thinking about that pretty much 0.01% of the time I'm playing the game. <br/><br/>Even if those two elements of the game are nice, they are inseparable from the core gameplay loop of this game. There may not be a game that scratches the same itch as this universe (in reality there are multiple), but it just simply isn't worth playing this to experience it because of the package it's wrapped in. It's an amazing business model for Bungie, but it comes at the (non-financial) expense of the player in my opinion. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Part 2: Games and the real world<br/><br/>As with many things in human civilization, we don't know what we're doing when it comes to video games. We're still in an early stage with video games I think and we don't have a good enough understanding as a society on how they interact with our lives. The prevalence of games like this and mobile games that are meant to get you addicted and suck away your time is really not good. To me, these sorts of games, like social media, are just predatory in how they take advantage of the mechanics of our brains.<br/><br/>Honestly, China might be justified in limiting gameplay time to 3 hours a week and docking your social credit score for excessive gaming. The more time you spend playing a video game (or watching reality tv or whatever), the less time you're spending on improving your real life. In a pErfEct worLd, we'd be able to do whatever we wanted if it made us happy. BUT THIS IS NOT A PERFECT WORLD*. If we're spending our time living in fantasies, then our lives and the rest of the world goes to shit. Now this might not happen as immediately as that sounds, but I do think this is something as a society that we're going to have to grapple with. Do we want to focus on real life and improving this shitshow of a world? Or do we want to sedate ourselves with media or whatever and neglect that? so basically just the message of Serial Experiments Lain.<br/><br/>Obviously it's not THAT binary and you can play video games/watch shit and still have a decent life. But it is honestly a verrry slippery slope imo. I don't have the data on-hand to reference for this, but we are seeing problems with these latest generations who've grown up on the internet and their competency as adults. (i'm very much in this category....). So i think this is something we're going to have to think about going forward (as if we aren't already doing enough wrong....)<br/><br/>How should video games be? How should they/entertainment as a whole interact with our lives?<br/><br/>In my opinion, stuff like battle royales that don't require you to grind for shit, that you play solely because it's fun, is much better than stuff like D2. Games with immersive stories and worlds, that might actually have some substance to them, are far better as well. Even with these though, I feel like you can very easily have too much of a good thing and neglect your real life as a result. I guess with forms of recreation prior to movies, tv shows, video games etc, we were probably doing things that were either A) beneficial to our physical health or B) more than likely had some kind of real world benefit to them (becoming a chess chad and meeting people through playing them, winning MONEY. playing instruments and getting clouted up thru it, etc). Basically parents were right when they said stop watching so much tv/playing so much vidja. Idk, i'm just letting this shit fly. Time for me to actually do this frickin scoowork<br/><br/>*the video i'm referencing in case you ain' know: <a href=""https://youtu.be/Kl3H4vMqYNo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/Kl3H4vMqYNo</a> "
Destiny 2,"I played Destiny 2 for around one year, from the middle of Shadowkeep to the middle of Beyond Light. It was fun at first. Played solo for a while, then joined a clan to be able to do more end-game activities. Still fun, learning dungeons and raids. The release of Beyond Light was fun, as was attempting a day one raid. Shortly after that it started loosing the appeal.<br/><br/>The game world is not that big, you'll be running a lot around in the same environments. There's just too much of repeating the same activities every week and completing bounties within those activities that force you to use something other than your favorite gear or play style. Everything seems to be about completing bounties and it's boring. On top of it, they started adding gear that was only possible to get if you solo kinda difficult content, while the game is much more fun with others.<br/><br/>I don't know... the game was fun, while the mechanics felt new and fresh. The gun play and movement is good. It's just that all the new content is doing more bounties for a different reason."
Destiny 2,"Chores the game. <br/><br/>If only this game had deeper and more interesting characters and narrative threads.<br/><br/>It's so addicting because it has some of the best gunplay of any game. It feels so good to get new weapons and get those sweet kills, while the progression loop is always rewarding the player. <br/><br/>But it is an empty shell that never leads anywhere. The PVP is very unfun, and it can be hard to find the right crew to play with. <br/><br/>The music and art-direction of this game are top notch."
Destiny 2,"I swear to god, Bungie butchers this game more and more with each and every update. The removal of SBMM seals the deal; this is quite possibly one of the worst balanced games ever."
Destiny 2,"Initial Review:<br/>Destiny 2 had a strong opening. I thought it looked very good and I enjoyed the actual campaign portion. I only ever played solo and once I beat the main campaign I stopped playing very quickly. The end game stuff didn’t interest me and I though the sense of progression died out too quick. This game was almost an A-.<br/><br/>Initial Score: B+<br/><br/>Journal Style Review:<br/>Okay this is the first time I’ve cared about cross play. I played destiny 2 on PlayStation and now I’m wanting to play the expansions on gamepass and I was not looking forward to having to start from scratch. The cross play was really easy to set up.<br/><br/>Not a great first session just because it was so confusing. I want to remember how the game works and how to pick up quests. And even how to find waypoints and things. It’s not the type of game you can just wander around aimlessly. There needs to be reasons to do things.<br/><br/>I really only want to do the campaigns, which I’ve googled how to do, but I’m concerned they won’t be fun because I will be so over leveled? There won’t be any sense of progression which is the whole point... I’ll give it a shot but I’m not so sure I’m going to actually play these.<br/><br/>Starting curse of Osiris...it’s too easy. Biggest complaint so far is that it isn’t balanced for power level 750, which is what it starts you at. So like what the fuck. And it’s a bummer too because the gunplay is really good. The gun variety is nice at the beginning at least. Lots of guns feel good so far. The enemies are fun to shoot at because they do a lot of interesting weak spots and immune spots, so from a gameplay perspective it’s entertaining. The actual art designs are kind of boring in a generic kind of way but not too bad. The environment is fun in a cheesy light hearted way as well.<br/><br/>Finished Osiris. It was fine. A bit generic. I only died once so there was no challenge which hurt it. This did not increased my score.<br/><br/>Start of Warmind. More of the same so far. Some firefights are getting a bit tougher...but I’m still not dying and I’m not getting a lot of loot so I’m getting bored of using the same guns.<br/><br/>I googled and realized I need to pick up guns from this robot mailman and need to do this quest so I can use these Engram things. It’s been more fun now that I’m getting new guns again. It took a lot of googling to figure out how to do everything though. Too much googling.<br/><br/>Uhh I beat Warmind. I didn’t realize the worm fight was the final fight. Pretty short and lame expansion actually. Well on to the forsaken.<br/><br/>Opening prison break mission of forsaken is better than any mission from the previous two expansions. The cutscenes were actually good. The action was pretty cool. The new enemy design looked cooler than most. There was some comedy in there also, I chuckled at least once. Strong start. I hope it keeps it up. This feels more like a real campaign.<br/><br/>I loved the second mission as well. The style of this game is way better. The enemies and environment is more to my taste. And the gameplay and guns I currently have are both very fun. Plus it’s harder. It’s not stupidly easy anymore.<br/><br/>The game forces you to do some bounties next which was actually an appropriate time for me to learn about bounties and to complete some of the public events. I won’t do a lot of these though. I still prefer traditional missions and think these events get repetitive fast. <br/><br/>I’m a big fan of the bow you get in this expansion. It’s sweet. Going around hunting these bosses is very fun. It’s great gameplay too. This forsaken dlc is about the same quality as my first impression of the base game. It’s a very high B+. Like just barely below an A-.<br/><br/>I’ve said it before but I need to say it again. The gameplay is really good. It’s the games biggest strength. It’s a fast paced and feels so smooth. The repetitive structure of the game is not as big an issue because the guns are so fun to use and the combat feels so precise.<br/><br/>Finished forsaken. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Partly because the environment, story and enemies were better, but also because I just had a better understanding on how things work. I was getting better gear and actually making progress. <br/><br/>Start of shadowkeep. First impression is I don’t hate the aesthetic of moon. Opening mission was not bad.<br/><br/>After playing for maybe 4 hours in this dlc It’s getting a bit repetitive again for me. Forsaken was the peak. <br/><br/>These “campaign” missions are getting cheap. Kill 100 enemies is not a mission this deep in a game. I’ve already free roamed your moon map. It’s overkill.<br/><br/>Finished the campaign. I was pretty bored by the end. It gets too repetitive and there aren’t enough missions that are actually designed so the enjoyment is very heavily reliant on how much I like the guns I have. The original base game score was a very high B+. If I reviewed these 4 expansions as a complete independent product, it would have only been a mid level B+. <br/><br/>Beyond Light Coop Review:<br/>Completing the last DLC, and whatever other side content, with 2 friends. I’m finally playing this game the way it’s supposed to be played.<br/><br/>The game is definitely better with others. I’ve been enjoying gambit as well as messing around with the story missions but the latest DLC is again lazy and feels cheap and repetitive again. They aren’t campaigns. They just set up new locations and missions for prolonged grinding for those that enjoy it. Destiny 2 doesn’t pull me in enough for me to want to grind away. I do want to complete a raid that these guys keep talking about.<br/><br/>I’m quadrupling down on my opinion that destiny is super confusing. All the different places you have to go to get bounties and the upgrade systems and all that I just don’t find intuitive or well explained.<br/><br/>If you are partied up but you don’t stay close enough during certain parts of the campaign you don’t get the progress. It happened a couple times. Just another quality of life thing.<br/><br/>The dungeon was a highlight though. The long commitment is daunting and the mystery of what to do was confusing at first but I really enjoyed it overall. That was a unique experience I had not done before.<br/><br/>Played all the dungeons and they were fun. Played a bunch of gambit. Played some strikes. Played some pvp. The game is fine and it’s fun playing with friends but I don’t feel any desire to grind out higher levels and gear. I feel like I have experienced all destiny 2 has to offer at this point.<br/><br/>Final Score: B+"
Destiny 2,"I see the addicting qualities, but over all the game suffers from many flaws. Combat, enemies and level design are all extremely repetitive and lackluster. Skins and weapons are in variety, but this does not make up for the terribly basic combat. the story is also extremely bad and full of exposition. This game is appealing to some, but to those who want quality games.. well then you will be sorely disappointed."
Destiny 2,"Never played Destiny 1. Never really played modern online games and my only experience was with Unreal Tournament and Quake 3. Oh, those times... <br/><br/>So I approach Destiny 2 as a fresh and casual solo player. I was not disappointed. The basic story was OK, the ""Osiris"" expansion was a disappointment, but ""Warming"" was OK. Shooting is fun. I was a bit worried about all these other players (I've heard stories about online games), but it turned out ok. Public events were fine. I'm a solo player, so I'm missing a lot of stuff Destiny 2 has to offer, but as long as you approach the game with proper mindset, the game becomes a great shooter that provides a lot of fun. "
Destiny 2,"I was excited to play this game and was hoping it would exceed where Destiny 1 came short to keep my attention. Unfortunately this didn't change with the second one and I ended up leaving the game unfinished. While I do enjoy the loot system and customizing your character with new gear, it feels like you have the exact same items as other people your same level and class. I wish they would build on this and bring some more variety to the gameplay."
Destiny 2,"<div>I’ll start with disadvantages. First off, I’d say this is the smallest expansion to date among all expansions to the series. Also, devs could make use of a couple months to refine the original game and release the expansion afterwards. </div><div><br/></div><div>

The game mechanics and environments are great, tho. It’s worth playing overall, just don’t expect much.
<br/></div>"
Destiny 2,"You can’t call that a MMO for that would be an insult the dying genre. Nor You can call that a shooter for that would be an insult for a few great games released. Nor you can call that an RPG for that it would be an insult for great games like Divinity 2 released this year. The only positive things here are great optimization and perhaps graphics.

The gameplay is repetitive shooting against stupid AI, the campaign is boring to the point that you try to get through it as fast as possible. The game consists of 95% grinding and 5% dull content like weapons which just get reskinned with your level progression. 
"
Destiny 2,"Games as Service games generally suck, but at least destiny has cool combat"
Destiny 2,8/10
Destiny 2,gene
Destiny 2,"A good game, well balanced and great to play with friends."
Destiny 2,"God Damn piece of disappointment. Bungie plez, do it better next time!!!"
Destiny 2,best co-op game ever!
Fallout 4,"I find Fallout 4 is by a wide Margin the best Part yet. With over 200 Hours of F3 and more than 100 Hours FNV I can say this. The decisive Features can be found in the numerous positive Reviews. I will deal with a few Points from the negative reviews in this Review, because part of the above Criticisms are simply Nonsense: 1. Radiation The Radiation now directly affects the maximum Health. The Environment is much more irradiated. If you just swim over a River and eat a few Sugar Bombs you lose just 20% of your maximum Life, which you can regain by taking RadAway.
In F3 and FNV, radiation Was a Joke. It wasn't until 200 a wheel That you got a low Radiation Sickness and a small Debuff. The new System intervenes much more directly in the Flow of the game. Bed-beamed Foods must be consumed with care, RadAway is scarce. Moreover, Food in this Part is also much stronger than in F3, where it was only simple Commodity And hardly brought TP healing.
2. Skill system A Comparison with F3 I don't start here only where you can only fix the Attribute, repair the Skills, kl. Weapons and Haggling needed and one had won the Game, even at the highest Level of Difficulty. New Vegas was already much more balanced, so all the Skills were usable. Language did not Play a role in F3, but in NV it was one of the most important Skills. The Skill options in Fallout 4 are numerous and customizable for each Gameplay. One finds here the well-known Special Abilities such as ""Lead stomach"" or ""Bloody Death,"" which are now tied to the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes. Skills Such as Language, Repair, Haggling are omitted. I find the new System more tidy and it also fulfils the Requirement that you can individualise.
3. Karma System I don't understand what People here have all the time with the painted Carma System. In F3 was the total Cheese, all at times you could donate Water and thus improve your Karma significantly. From Archvillain to wasteland Savior with 20x-treated Water. In NV, the Karma System was already more striking. Depending on The Karma, customized Dialogue options and Companions who were chickled. In F4, I find it better solved. Actions and Decisions in Quests (similar to Dragon Age Origins) directly affect the Companion's Favor, which makes appropriate Comments.
4. Dialogue and Quests Dialogue Options and Quests were not really good in Any Case out. Much more interesting were the Stories that the Environment has in store. And there's a Lot of That, the new Fallout.
5. Grade One of the Points never mentioned in the Comparisons with predecessors is the Difficulty level. Fallout 3 was even on very hard much too easy. A few Raiders killed, whose Weapons were collected and repaired, were already handed out good Damage. In New Vegas gabs finally a Hardcore Mode with new Debuffs, such as Fatigue or Hunger, and Stimpaks with duration of Action. As a fallout veteran, though, I found that too easy myself.
With the new Combat System in F4, it's much more challenging. The AI also has a lot more in Petto. I still have too little of everything with Level 11 at the highest Level of difficulty. I have to divide my Stuff in and take advantage of the Surprise Moment, which makes the Game enormously exciting and Action for me.
Verdict: The new gameplay elements are almost just Improvements. The only Blemish on this Piece of JEWELLERY is the poor PHP (although the one in PipBoy Menus in the Predecessor was not much different) as well as the Key Occupancy. I quickly got used to it. But because of such little Quirks to give a game a Bad Rating is incomprehensible to me."
Fallout 4,"Plunging into the world of the apocalypse is pleasant as always. The game world is well filled with nice little things and funny characters. If you do not find fault with the shortcomings, you can enjoy it."
Fallout 4,"This is actually kinda trash. World is pretty uninteresting, laughable focus on loot - most of it LITERAL junk - and most side quests are largely just ""go to location and fight shooty guys or 28 Days Later zombies. Later orcs w/guns will be introduced."" There's just nothing TO this game. Even the story is just absurd and that's before the lack of dialogue options, meaningful choices, or any semblance of verisimilitude.<br/><br/>It also is nothing like Boston. Like would people seriously remember neighborhood names and that Massachusetts is called a ""Commonwealth"" but forget what Fenway Park of all places is called? Doesn't meet the standards set by New Vegas for story or reactivity, doesn't meet the standards even Skyrim and Fallout 3 set for sense of place and worldbuilding. Just bad."
Fallout 4,"To be honest, I was not impressed. I don't understand what all the fuss is about. The game is okay to play once =("
Fallout 4,"Very interesting, dynamic, fun to play game with deep message against war.<br/>Man! Where do we start on this one. This game is lengthy, very lengthy. In order to come to a point to sense of accomplishment, you play 100+ hours. The game starts in a near-doom-era and takes you to a safe vault right when a nuclear war starts. You wake up alone with your family lost and search for your boy. In your quest, you get to meet a variety of factions, The Minutemen, Mutants, Synthetic humans, Raiders, The Railroad, The Institute, Ghouls, Gunners, Children of Atom, ... the list goes on. You have to carefully choose your side among the 4 major groups, because in the end you can ally with only one and the rest will have to be destroyed. The game is dark and foggy (understandably), the choice of weapons is strange and initially the resources (even bullets) are scarce. Your character gets upgraded on each level-up (I reached to level 62), but you can NEVER fully upgrade your character with all skills available. AI of this game is superb, you also have companions - dog, robot, human, mutant, ghoul, whatever you like. There are 3 different cities you get missions in, major one being Common wealth. Missions are always available, there's no limit on how many you can get. Even bartenders have a few for you. So, practically you can never ""complete"" the game, and you don't have to. You can finish the main story and be satisfied. There's a moral lesson in this game. Each decision you make results in consequences, which you'll have to live with. A true reflection of the real lives of people in power. It is not easy to make it a happy ending for everyone. PS: A ton of violence, gore and coarse language. Not at all suitable for minors."
Fallout 4,"Fallout 4 was quite disappointing for me. The game isn’t horrible. It still has a fun apocalypse vibe to it. But I thought this could be a top tier game and what I end up with is a mid level third tier. The RPG progression in this game isn’t very good. There should be more constant progression. I gave no fucks about the settlement building part of the game. That didn’t captivate me at all. I still liked exploring the wasteland and trying to find new interesting quests and items and places but the quality of the quests, items and places wasn’t as high as I had hoped. I can see why someone would still really like this game but it wasn’t for me.<br/><br/>Final Score: B+"
Fallout 4,I wasn't a huge fan of the fallout series until fallout new Vegas and this one I like the quests and story Really amazing but honestly what keeps me coming back to the game is the mods beating the game the first time was amazing but then when the mods came out it got 10 times better and now I find myself coming back every week just to see what mods they have on can't recommend this game enough.
Fallout 4,"This game should not work. It is buggy as hell years after release, there are branches of story that just seem to be repetitive, and it honestly gives you both too much guidance as well as not enough at times.<br/><br/>But it’s a game I couldn’t put down.<br/><br/>I love it so much"
Fallout 4,"This game would be fine if Fallout 3 and Fallout 3: New Vegas haven't existed. This one, considering the time has passed since F3 is too similar and too safe and it evolved in unnecessary places where it tried (dialogue, building, character progression). I felt burned out halfway through the main storyline and I am done with this series until it  evolves again."
Fallout 4,Best game in the series. I've lost count of how many times I've replayed it.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the next one.
Fallout 4,"the game is very good, but I think it would be better if it had online mode, if the graphics were a little better, and if the story was shorter xD"
Fallout 4,"If you like «Bring me some apples»-quests for 50+ level hero — you definitely should try Fallout 4. <br/><br/>Forget about speech-focused characters, in dialogues you could perform not better than a sinth. The difference is only in a voice.<br/><br/>Minecraft mechanics is really boring because of the lack of objects."
Fallout 4,8
Fallout 4,I'd rather watch the same episode of Dr Phil on repeat before touching this again. 4/10
Fallout 4,Qqqq
Fallout 4,"Base building sucks, everything else rules."
Fallout 4,"Buggy, but fun. Lacking a lot of choice, and could get boring after playing for a while."
Fallout 4,"it may has it issues , but still very enjoyable"
Fallout 4,Not bad... Not bad at all!..
DOOM (2016),i needed to go on a 3 month dopamine detox after shitting myself to this game for 12 hours straight. 10/10
DOOM (2016),"Been a bit since i finished this so it's not super fresh in my mind but this was pretty great. A shooter that's actually challenging on normal difficulty. This has been said a million times already but the soundtrack SLAPPPS. Also zero bugs (was playing ps4 version on ps5), flawless in that regard. The story and lore are solid. The real world tie-ins with energy crises and issues of humanity's expansion are very relevant. The satire is great too. Level design is really fine-tuned. Linear game but with plenty of secrets to find if you're paying attention. Highly recommend. More thoughts + comparisons to follow in Doom Eternal review"
DOOM (2016),"my boyfriend is playing it and its horrible, fast and that fact give me anxiety and the music is so heterosexual the vibes are so jordi wild....... 0 points"
DOOM (2016),"The absolute best game for someone that doesn't play many first-person shooters. The combat is wonderful for all skill levels and playstyles. A campy story that fits the world very well, and truly unique weapon and enemy variety. A true treat for any player, highly accessible for beginners. Do yourself a favor and up the difficulty halfway through the game if you started in the easiest difficulty, it makes you feel as if you as a player are progressing with the game and with your ever increasing arsenal. Play with a controller for a solid, punchy arcade-style feeling, play mouse and keyboard if you're in higher difficulty and the precision requires it. Only two downsides for this game: backtracking through some levels can hinder the experience and bog down the gameplay; early maps do a subpar job of differentiating their color schemes and layouts, leading the player to get lost at the beginning stages. Overall, a solid 4/5 I plan to come back and master further."
DOOM (2016),"2016 was an otherwise average year for Gaming, but this game elevated that year and gave me something fun to play on my own, rather than booting up my 360 and playing Arkham City for the 100th time. Shooting is as addicting as it is fun, play this if you want that classic 90s feel, or if you're bored"
DOOM (2016),"My pp grew 15 cm while I played this game.<br/>The fucking testosterone is oozzing out of this game.<br/><br/>And the OST... THAT FUCKING OST, MAN.<br/>Legit my favourite OST out of any game."
DOOM (2016),The perfect combination of modern FPS implementation and classic arcade FPS gameplay. Fresh takes on everything from weapon design to... resource management. Glory kill system really shakes things up by changing how the game is played.
DOOM (2016),"DOOM was without a doubt the game that kickstarted the FPS genre through the first game released back in 1993, and now it's back with a fourth entry.

Let's just get this straight; the game is fantastic. <br/><br/>The gameplay forces you to think quickly, and constantly be on the move. The gunplay is exceptional. As you ""rip and tear"" through the campaign, you'll unlock new guns, which all feel unique and different from one another. There's also a bit of ""resource management"" involved, as you'll have to know when to or not to use the brutal glory kills, which not only has a nice gory animation but also rewards you with ammo and health. Sadly, the game loses its charm towards the end, mainly due to the repetitive level design. After 10 hours of gameplay, entering arenas upon arenas filled with new demons to kill isn't as satisfying as in the beginning. I also found the lack of bosses a bit disappointing. There are nearly no bosses in the game, and when you finally encounter one, there isn't much challenge involved.

<br/><br/>The soundtrack is another amazing thing about DOOM. The composer Mick Gordon did an exceptional job with his heavy-metal soundtrack, perfectly fitting the gory and hellish nature of the game. You just want to turn the volume up every time you play the game.

<br/><br/>For those of you looking for an engaging story, DOOM will disappoint. But storytelling was never a part of DOOM, and will probably never be. However, this is far from bad. Sometimes you just want to have fun playing games without having to engage in a story at the same time, and for that purpose, DOOM is perfect.

<br/><br/>Also included with DOOM is a multiplayer experience, with modes such as the classic DOOM deathmatch. While this was fun, it wasn't something I could see myself playing a lot, so therefore I don't have a lot to say about it.

<br/><br/>Overall, DOOM is a satisfying FPS experience filled with gore, and of course, demons. While it does lose its charm towards the end, it's still a game worth buying.

<br/><br/>Overall Score: 8/10 - Excellent
<br/>+ Satisfying combat
<br/>+ Great soundtrack
<br/>- Loses its charm towards the end
<br/>- The bosses could have been better"
DOOM (2016),"the single-player campaign is fun, but the importance of melee finishers makes the mechanic lose its luster quickly, especially considering there aren't many invincibly frames afterwards - you can sometimes be hit right as you regain control after an execution, which is damning in higher difficulties. this means you have to be careful not to execute all the time, but choosing not to means missing out on health and ammo, and having to pump more ammo from afar into the enemy you could have quickly finished off. <br/><br/>also, the cutscenes are unskippable and long, which kills replayablity, especially since the story has nothing to recommend it, and many times doomguy fails to grab a ledge during a platforming section even as you feel confident in your execution<br/><br/>tons of work went into multiplayer and custom level creation, but that part of this game hasn't resulted in any fun for me."
DOOM (2016),"Doom is one of the best FPS shooter campaigns of this generation. It’s difficult but still has you feeling like a demon slayer who can’t be stopped. The visuals were fantastic and the story, although not super complex, was entertaining. The atmosphere and lore are well done. Gameplay is Dooms best feat though. Doom is super smooth fast paced hectic mayhem in all the right ways.<br/><br/>Final Score: A"
DOOM (2016),"Would've preferred a more straightforward shooter with the time spent on implementing the upgrading elements and secrets in more interesting levels. Looking for upgrade parts, secrets and trying to complete challenges interrupts the action, but gives some length to this otherwise short game. Music is awesome."
DOOM (2016),The most fun I've ever had playing a shooter. You'd be hard-pressed to find another game that's as exhilarating and white-knuckle as Doom amongst the current FPS fair. Can't wait for the sequel.
DOOM (2016),"The game starts and you're already killing demons. It's incredibly satisfying. Shoot shoot and shoot. No story, just frenetic combat."
DOOM (2016),"Crazy, fast-paced FPS fun that has you diving around the action instead of taking cover 75% of the time. For the most part it's nonstop action, but there are a few unskippable in-game cutscenes that I always dread getting to. I played this on the Switch in handheld mode, and while I still had a pretty remarkable time, it very clearly plays better on a PC or any console with larger controllers. There was also a glitch I briefly ran into that made menu navigation impossible unless I restarted the console, but that was hardly an issue in the long run. "
DOOM (2016),good games
DOOM (2016),One of the most thrilling FPS games I can remember ever playing. I haven't done crystal meth but this is what I imagine it is like. Hopefully with less blood.
DOOM (2016),Amazing graphics and good performance especially if you choose Vulkan. The gameplay is so addictive and the story line excellent. <br/><br/>Highly recomended.
DOOM (2016),7.0/10.0
DOOM (2016),"Fast, vicious, gory and the OST is hyping up perfectly"
DOOM (2016),PC	2014-2017
DOOM (2016),Loved it
DOOM (2016),10/10
DOOM (2016),.
DOOM (2016),fast paced demon shooting.  second only to its sequel in that regard.
DOOM (2016),Incredibly fun with the best feeling shotgun I've experienced so far.
DOOM (2016),Mindless brutal killing demons doesn´t get any better than this &lt;3 
DOOM (2016),This game is absolutely amazing. Play it.
DOOM (2016),"Utterly dreadful reboot. Slow as treacle, lacking any semblance of fun"
DOOM (2016),I really love how fast the gameplay is and the music couldn't be more perfect! 
Team Fortress 2,"This Review refers to the latest Update and Introduction of Competive Mode ...
Why am I playing hundreds of Hours of this Game? Why do I spend whole Nights with Friends in the most diverse Game modes of TF2? Because Team Fortress had one thing until that Moment that set it apart from other Casual Shooters ... ES GEHT ONLY UM SPASS.
TF2 didn't need Rankings, it was a Speil you played from SPASS. MAn wanted to find out the endless Possibilities of the Classes and explore the lovingly designed Maps. Now I wait 20 Minutes for a Game just so I can wait 10 Minutes again because someone is afk and he can't be kicked.
The Competive Modues destroyed this Game; In COD Fashion, the Players get excited about everything and everyone because you don't want to lose your sooooo beloved Points. As for the new Layout ... Personally, I hate it; It's unnecessarily complicated, unnecessarily not written and it takes far too long to start a simple Game.
I have not invested 50 Hours in the new Update and can explain to you in detail what is like where, that's because I don't want to put 50 ' hours into this System when the first two game Sessions have already annoyed me. I will leave Team Fortress alone for some Time.
Did they maybe put it out in such a hurry because Valve feels (on good Grounds) threatened by Overwatch? Right-Valve has now received serious Competition for the very first Time and we see what this ""Competive"" has brought-Valve destroys Team Fortress itself"
Team Fortress 2,"(Just before you get to the review: I can't decide whether to make them more serious, or leave it that way. You decide. Thanks in Advance) From because of New is better.
Team Fortress 2 is 7.5 Years old and troz this with one of the most played games in the World.
If you think directly now: ""Uuh, the Game is free to play, I have to buy everything to be able to play anyway,"" you can go right back.
TF2 has been freely made available and you can buy weapons and Cosmetics, but you don't need it!
All Weapons in the Game are equally strong and differ only in gameplay, similar to the 9 Characters in the Game: 1.: Scout: For Players who like to run around and want to be fast at the Front.
2nd: Soldier: Can Jump rock and fire rockets.
3rd: Pyro: Has Fire under the Butt.
4.: Demoman: Shoots Grenades, is Black, Scottish and Alcoholic.
5.: Heavy: A Lot of Damage, but is slow.
6.: Engineer: For People who can't meet.
7.: Medic: As the Name suggests. Medic.
8.: Sniper: For People who can meet.
9.: Invisible, and pushes something in from The Back.
Fun aside, although the Game has existed for so long come non-stop updates out and never let the Game get boring.
The Game has many Modes like which everyone knows: Capturing the Flag or taking Over points.
But there is also MvM: Man vs. Machine, is a Coop Variant from TF2 where players have to prove themselves against huge Hordes of Robots.
There is nothing to fault about the Game, in my Opinion.
Thumbs up and Hail to you Gifts.
PS: Team Fortress has 12 Letters and there are 9 Characters! 12 – 9 = 3 Team Fortress 3 confirmed!!!"
Team Fortress 2,i lied about the other shooters.. this game is kinda fun and kinda slaps the poop right out of you 8/10
Team Fortress 2,"I remember the vanilla «Team Fortress 2» when I played it in the summer of 2009. I recently stopped by to see what happened to it. The game is not obsolete and it's just as lively to play. The reason is the cartoonish graphics and dynamics of the game, as well as the lore of each character and the awesome music by Mike Morasky.<br/><br/>Cases and hats aren't my thing, but I did enjoy the new modes, like «Mann vs. Machines».<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend it. The game is immortal."
Team Fortress 2,"This is a painful game to review because I've put 650 hours into this game and I actually agree with a lot of the points made by the positive reviewers.  The music and atmosphere is very well done, the game has a rich history and a lively community, the core classes are well-balanced, and much of the gameplay has been polished into a bright sheen.  How can I give this game a negative review given my personal history and these positive elements?<br/><br/>Well, the reality is that the core matchmaking and gameplay has gotten steadily worse through the years to the point where, today, I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone unless they are interested in the history or just curious about trying the game.  The basic challenge is that Valve clearly no longer wants to put any time or energy into managing the game, resulting in:<br/>* No updates for an absurd length of time to the gameplay or lore (either in the not-so-recent past or in the forseeable future).  While the core characters are pretty well-balanced at this point, the game gets boring when months pass without any new maps, guns, or features being added.  <br/>* A growing spambot/cheating problem.  Gone are the days when aimbots and spammers were culled due to improvements to either the Valve Anti-Cheat system or better moderation.  Instead, these problems are endemic, to the point where a large portion of games are ruined by these items and a good proportion of even satisfactory games are spent trying to get the other team to kick their aimbot so they don't walk away with an easy victory.<br/>* To deal with the spambot problem, you now have to pay to use the core text/voice chat functionality, which is pretty necessary to perform basic gameplay coordination and is a pretty basic F2P feature.  Okay, you can go Premium for $5 to fix this, but given the issues above this is another strike against the game.  (Also, yeah, I was F2P for that entire time, but this wasn't an issue until recent updates).<br/>* Matchmaking is completely broken.  While joining a game originally lead you to a decently full server about to start and a lively game, half the time you now join a game that is being plagued with auto-aim bots, that's half empty, or that's about to end.  Again, this is something that even Valve's other major F2P property (Dota 2) can figure out even matching players by skill level, so the lack of care here is further indicative of Valve's lack of investment.  <br/><br/>Given all of these issues, I don't think the game is very interesting or fun to play any more.  While existing fans of the game may want to continue playing for their own reasons, my rating reflects my judgement that this game just isn't worth the time anymore.  Not recommended."
Team Fortress 2,This was the best multiplayer FPS out there when it was released.<br/><br/>But it's been a long time and honestly I have no idea what happened in the interim.
Team Fortress 2,"TF2 is 13 years old at the time of writing of this review, and the game is showing it's age.  The constant evolution of the game over the decade plus it's been around has made for a higher quality gaming experience, while at the same time turning the engine into a creaking structure buckling under it's own strain.<br/><br/>TF2 is a staple of Steam multiplayer games running on the Source engine.  It's original design philosophy is a case study for game designers of all stripes, and the art style of the game is beautiful and unique.  The characters are all interesting, with fun voice acting and lots of personality.  Hearing the characters banter with each other was a mindblowing bit of immersive storytelling at the time.<br/><br/>The extended ""lore"" developed around the game, from bricks of Austrailium , the introduction of MANN CO, and the high value of gravel, is fun and unique.  The comics, stories, and short form videos are all gems.  And the Saxxy award winning community videos are amazing.<br/><br/>The game is on the old side, though, and it has it's flaws.  But it's free to play, so if you can find a server not crawling with aimbots and hackers, it's worth playing a few rounds of this classic."
Team Fortress 2,I have far too many memories with this game to ever truly part away from it. It's always been a classic and always will be.
Team Fortress 2,"Nowadays it's a mess of tacked-on features, but the core gameplay hasn't taken a scratch. The best class-based FPS ever made, and it's free. Playerbase has remained stable since at least 2013, play it if you can."
Team Fortress 2,The matchmaking needs to be fixed. Now it’s so horrible that completely ruins everything good I love about this game. 
Team Fortress 2,"It’s a masterpiece from Valve. The game is well-balanced and enjoyable, with plenty of interesting characters. Don’t think, play."

PAYDAY 2,"The Game concept itself is very interesting and despite some Inconsistencies, such as bad Hit boxes or Map Collision bugs, there may well be Fun.
A Warning goes especially to anyone who is thinking of buying the Game now that it has a massive Number of DLCs, which should only be purchased at 75% Discounts.
Microtransactions have also recently been added, which directly affect the Flow of The game, as you can also get free Weapon Upgrades instead of the ""Safes"" (á la Boxes in CS: GO).
So The Safes reduce the Chance of just this and in addition (Because it would be too nice if it had all been ...) was clearly tricked at the Weapon balance.
Many Weapons now have worse Statistics such as Hit accuracy or Camouflage, which can only be compensated for by very rare Skins that balance these Stats.
If the Money is there and Koop Games interest you, a Purchase is highly recommended, but you should bring a few Friends.
MfG Retia"
PAYDAY 2,"Payday 2 is, in my Opinion, a Game that does pretty much everything right. 
The Game principle itself brings a wonderful renewal to the Game world of CoD &amp; Co, because apart from The first Part of Payday, there is no game known to me that the Bank Robber implements his so well. 
The Game is never unfair, you need some Skill to master higher Orders, the Problem is just that the Game is relatively controlled without a Team. The AI has the only advantage that it can refuel well, but otherwise the AI is striver-stupid. Many of the Initial Missions are still to be mastered with AI, but it is almost too impossible for the higher Orders unless one tries to create the Missions undetected. 
The only really negative Aspect that comes to mind is that 3/4 of the Missions are useless even at the highest level of difficulty for the high lvl Players because they bring neither a lot of money nor a lot of exp. This means that you have to limit yourself to a few missions in the high levels. In My Opinion, these Missions are enough, but some others may be bothered by them. 
The Weapons in payday 2 are quite varied, despite the funny Names that have been changed, so the G36C is the JPG36. 
One of the Biggest Advantages of the game I find is that you can do the Missions in your Own Way, you can try it completely silently, you can try to row it or just mow it all around with a lot more clenched until you are at the charcoal. 
All in all, Payday 2 is one of the best Shooters on the Market and is therefore totally recommended, it is therefore not a Game for People who don't like to think and prefer to follow strict instructions. Above All, you shouldn't get the Game if you don't have good Nerves."
PAYDAY 2,"When considering the price and that Payday 2 often goes on sale for a dollar, it's not a bad deal. It is fun to shoot and conduct heists for a little while but it quickly becomes stale. As you play more, the sameyness becomes very apparent. Playing with friends and the rather in-depth build crafting helps remedy this problem a little but that stuff only goes so far. Also, there is way too much DLC. However, I would still recommend it because you can get a good bit of fun for the price that you pay."
PAYDAY 2,"It's probably cool with friends but it's also hard to get into, but even though i played it with random people it was enjoyable"
PAYDAY 2,"This game can start good, you will have some few time of fun but after you play for some time everything starts to be too much repetitive."
PAYDAY 2,"It’s just the same Payday 2 for consoles and PC but portable now.  The port itself has bugs sometimes low frame rate, sometimes getting stuck on loading screens. Switch version won’t disappoint you if you’re a fan of Payday 2. But most awful thing is no normal voice chat/ It is critical for such type of game."
PAYDAY 2,"Finally, a good port for Switch! And without annoying little kids on the voice chat. The quality is very close to the PS4’s, so, I guess, it’s the best version possible. I’ll even dare to say that it’s the best version of Payday 2 up to date. Convince me! "

PAYDAY 2,GET THE FUCK UP
Horizon Zero Dawn,My first game on PlayStation. I played a lot like a noob. But that didn't stop me from enjoying the game.
Horizon Zero Dawn,"Didn’t find it interesting, story was derivative and Disney-like, combat was stiff and fighting machines wasn’t fun for me. I’m sad because I really wanted to love it."
Horizon Zero Dawn,"I first caught wind of Horizon Zero Dawn from a friend I believe way back when the game wasn’t even released yet. My first reaction to Horizon was that I wanted to play it; the game looked like it combined things that I really liked in games: mostly exploration and good combat against a variety of enemies. But what made Horizon stand out to me was that the machines you fight were made out of different parts and tearing them off could change the battle significantly. I had high expectations for the game, the only thing that really kept me from playing it was its exclusivity, which wasn’t addressed up until recently, 3+ years after the game came out initially. Waiting for the game to release really put out all the hype I had for it and having played it now, even without said expectations, the game was still disappointing to me and I can’t really recommend it. <br/><br/>Let's start with the things that Horizon does best in my opinion: the world and the story. In many games, there are things that we accept although they don't really make sense in the game's world, things like: enemies respawning infinitely, enemies specific to one level or region in the map, enemies dropping just one or two pieces of an item. Many games do not have answers to those questions but Horizon does, it's not always a satisfying answer though I appreciate how Horizon gives those inexplicable aspects in games an actual explanation. <br/><br/>As for the actual story of the game, I didn’t think highly of it. This is because of one major issue: the story is too predictable. I already knew what was going to happen by the time the story revealed its big twist. The game drops some big hints right at the start of the main quest and that took out the mystery in the story for me. If you like a story that keeps you guessing, this isn’t it. <br/><br/>Let’s get into the combat of Horizon. The combat in Horizon starts off great but goes downhill once you have already seen every enemy. The first time you see an enemy, you scan it to learn more about it. What does each component do, what is the best way to initiate combat, etc. The difficulty curve of Horizon, at least at the start, is made by introducing tougher and tougher enemies to fight though after this, the game doesn’t really know how to ramp up the difficulty from there after you see the last enemy in the list. The difficulty curve of Horizon at that point comes from increasing the number of enemies you fight at a time. The difference between midgame and endgame encounters is the number of enemies you have to keep track of. If you hate combat against groups of enemies in games, you will probably dislike Horizon’s combat too. Also, there aren’t really any bosses in Horizon; once you see every enemy, you have pretty much seen every enemy the game has. On the player’s side, there are a lot of weapons to use but you are restricted to having only four at any given time. This means that you either have to just use your favorites or to navigate the menu every time you want to use a specific weapon. I did the former.<br/><br/>Next is the exploration. The world of Horizon Zero Dawn is gorgeous. The machines are very lifelike and have very natural movements, the stylized lighting and level of detail in the game are a sight to behold, and the various locations you go through are varied and are twisted enough to feel familiar yet mysterious. Though the world itself is beautiful, exploring it isn’t. There isn’t really much to do out in the world aside from combat, sightseeing, and story. Moving around in Horizon is just average. You ‘climb’ mountains, cliffs, towers, etc. by following a predetermined path while looking at the pretty visuals. You swim through rivers and lakes, watching the reflections on the water while waiting for your character to get to land. And when you’re on land, you walk/sprint to the next quest marker while basking in the beauty of the world. I wouldn’t call this bad but I wouldn’t call it good either. <br/><br/>That pretty much sums up my thoughts on Horizon Zero Dawn. I think that the above is enough for you to gauge whether you will like this game or not without getting too deep into it. While it has some amazing visuals and a good enough story, the combat and the open-world exploration has many flaws that make me not recommend it outright. But if you think that what I’ve been saying sounds awesome, then go ahead and buy it. I hope you’ll have a good time.

Horizon Zero Dawn,"This game is amazing.  A huge open world that never felt boring.  I know that people push back against the side missions, but I enjoyed meeting new people and running the errands. The combat is smooth and an amazing story. I loved climbing up and looking over the world and the platforming bits were excellently structured.  Must play...must play."
Horizon Zero Dawn,"Fantastic open world, gameplay and experience. 'NExt gen' gets thrown around a lot but this was truly a step above other games and a unique experience "
Horizon Zero Dawn,It's a nice and very pretty time waster but that's it.<br/>The spin on the apocalypse was nice though.
Horizon Zero Dawn,"I was super late to the party on this one, because I had no interest in buying a PS4, but my wife is a JRPG dork, so we finally got one, and I figured I may as well play this.<br/><br/><div>Wow, had I been missing out. This one game, to me, justified the cost of our PS4 Pro.</div><div><br/></div><div>Instantly joined my top 10 games of all time.<br/></div>"
Horizon Zero Dawn,"Not going to lie...had this game sitting around for a long time before I actually picked it up to play it. Once I started though...I was pretty hooked. First of all, the story was fantastic, and I won't ruin some of the plot twists but the ending was sufficiently satisfying that I can't wait for the second one.<br/><br/>As far as gameplay goes, combat was extremely fun - different than most games that release now, this wasn't just a shooter. Using the bow and spear required what felt like more precision, and added some layers to the combat that isn't there when you're just aiming and shooting. The system of ""collecting"" different machines, as well as their evolutions, added some more to do around the main story - and it didn't feel like busy work like these sorts of quests often can."
Horizon Zero Dawn,"<div>This game is absolutely STUNNING. The environments are lush and plentiful. The music, the voice acting, the story! Just wow. It brought genuine emotion from me especially at the end. <br/></div><div><br/></div><div>
I don't want to accidentally spoil anything as the way the story and past unfolds is just incredible. Needless you say you live in a world dominated by machines who are animal-like whilst the people are more tribal.</div><div><br/></div><div> Aloy is a great protagonist and a pleasure to journey with. The combat is brutal at times and so satisfying. I'm glad I waited until I had upgraded my PS4 to a Pro to play it.</div>"
Horizon Zero Dawn,Very cool game. Really unique and well though-out world. The plot is engaging and worth it. Gameplay is freaking NICE. Hardpoint arrows and regen armor are a must tho. Soundtrack is nice. Also LANCE REDDICK IS IN THIS !!! <br/>Also just some time effing around exploring obscure map areas after I completed the game which was TIGHT. Can’t wait for a sequel 🙏
Horizon Zero Dawn,Primitive girl runs around shooting robot dinosaurs with a bow and arrow. This is what I'll say about it: The reason this game is so great is because it makes that first sentence make sense.
Horizon Zero Dawn,"Horizon Zero Dawn looks amazing. Every part of the presentation is fantastic. The environment, whether it’s the snow areas, lush forest areas, or desert areas all look amazing. The character models and the machines look amazing when just standing there but where this game takes it to a whole other level is the animations of Aloy and the machines. It is so impressive the way the machines and Aloy move and attack. It looks more natural and fluid than any other game Ive played. I don’t usually start with the games strongest pro but I think that the visual presentation of this game is it’s most impressive achievement. That being said it isn’t the only good thing about HZD. <br/><br/>The gameplay is very crisp as well. Now if you know me you know that I love using a bow in video games. I don’t know why, I just usually find it satisfying. This game has a lot of bow action if you choose to use it. I did. And I liked it. The different ways you have to pick apart the machines and the different types of effects your weapons can do creates a very dynamic, visually pleasing, combat system that is very enjoyable for a long time. The different machines behave in different ways so the enemy variety doesn’t get stale either for a long time. The first T. rex fight gets a shout out. Felt epic.<br/><br/>The rpg elements are good, but they aren’t anything unique or special. You have enough weapons to use and ways to upgrade them (although I used a lot of bows because they were my favourite). You gather resources a la Far Cry style to craft ammo and items. You gather resources from defeated machines. It’s fun and creates a sense of progression that games like this need and it does it in an enjoyable way that didn’t get repetitive for me.<br/><br/>The story I thought was good not great. I love the big picture main idea behind the story. Evolution of machines is right up my ally and it’s done in an interesting way. But the side quests and really most of the stuff wasn’t about the history of this fantastic world was just alright.<br/><br/>Final Score: A+"
Horizon Zero Dawn,"Absolute one of my favorite PS4 games. Love the world, scenery, creatures, different civilizations and the story."
Horizon Zero Dawn,"8/10
<br/><br/>+ Awesome premise/setting
<br/>+ Complex, varied combat
<br/>+ Aloy's character growth
<br/>+ Creative story kept me invested throughout
<br/>+ Excellent visuals in landscapes and lighting
<br/>+ Great design and scale for machines

<br/><br/>- Fierce difficulty spikes
<br/>- Too long; needed tightening up
<br/>- Open world felt a bit dated in some areas
<br/>- Delivery of exposition sometimes awkward; poor character models on side characters"
Horizon Zero Dawn,"A really great game, though not without faults. In short here are some of the nitpicks I gathered for otherwise a really superb experience which I recommend to almost anyone. The story is intriguing, the world and enemies are unique, the characters are interested and actual gameplay is superb. You can go in guns blazing and try to defeat enemies that way, or you can lay traps, ambush them and scan and hit enemies weak points for a lot easier and fun time. Now on the whining part:<br/><br/>&gt;The RPG aspect was weak, like really weak, this was my own fault expecting it to be a more fleshed out RPG, but nowadays as even Far Cry games have this genre attached I shouldn't be surprised I got what I got. But actual character choice and development from a skill point of view is really bare bones.<br/>&gt;This comes to a second fault, lack of weapon, armor etc variety defeats the purpose of exploring besides the joy of exploring (which should be the main part, but without a carrot dangling in the end, it gets boring after some time) as you will get the same pool of resources as you can get weapons and armor only from merchants due to lack of variety.<br/>&gt;Lots of cliches, while the overall story was good, there were many Holywood moments. I counted at least 3 times where a character died just at the moment I came in after giving me final words before his death.<br/>&gt;End boss fight was a bit disappointing"
Horizon Zero Dawn,"I'm pretty sure if you look up ""perfect game"" there's just a picture of this game's cover art. I genuinely can't say enough good things"
Horizon Zero Dawn,"Great game. Farcry fans may find similarity and underrate it just because they bored of towers and craft system. Pretty good story. I cant stand melee combat system, but it's good with other weapons. Huge variation of weapons and ways to kill things. I recommend playing on highest difficulty."
Horizon Zero Dawn,"pros: awesome visuals (landscapes, characters), lots of content | cons: weak main story, easy even on hard"
Horizon Zero Dawn,"Best game that I've ever played. It is the same entertainment level with GTA V and Batman Arkham City for me. Story, graphics, characters... All good. After I finished it, I played Frozen Wilds DLC and it was like a whole new game. A big extension. Fully recommended!"
Horizon Zero Dawn,"HZD is casual like a GAP pullover with it's simple exercises like running, jumping and archery. It looks great, speaking about graphics, but from the point of the story it's naked like a skeleton corpse. I could almost telepathically see the past when some bosses cut the budget for the story. <br/><br/>Oh, man, and the skill tree is so boring. Why actually I could not attack a creature jumping from above? I did it in many games before. More-loot-from-dinosaurs skill to make some more trash devices to hunt dinosaurs? Or maybe you are dreaming about super skill of grabbing a loot from corpses, sitting in a saddle of robohorse? Thanks a lot, that will be soooo helpful.<br/><br/>I mean, HZD is not so bad if you want some relaxed gaming and no so common setting. But tempted gamers will skip Horizon for sure."
Horizon Zero Dawn,"Definitely overrated game. I was really bored by plot and gameplay, but god... those dialogues were increadibly bad. I will only add that amount of monsters was really disappointing too, making new monsters by renaming older ones and giving them additional weapon. Last boss fight was boring, easy, a little bugged and totally too much simple. The only thing that I enjoyed in this game was landscape."
Horizon Zero Dawn,"My GOTY, 2017, and only Platinum trophy to date. Stunning game, especially in 4K with HDR on PS4 Pro."
Horizon Zero Dawn,"The DLC is amazing, the environment is stunning as always. My overall rate is absolutely recommend, but I’d like to cite some drawbacks. <br/>
First, I didn’t like the new ambush-style quests, there are just too many machines you have to kill. <br/>
Second, Frostclaw and Fireclaw. While the first can be fun, the latter is overpowered even for a high-level character and weapons a fight can take up to half an hour, and this is very tiresome. Also there’s AI cheating, both Claws can do a ground attack with a auto-target and large range. I once hid behind some rocks and then BOOM! I’m dead. So there’s you can run, but you can’t hide strategy.<br/>
Despite these flaws it’s still a great DLC, and if you like the original game, you should definitely buy this one.
"
Horizon Zero Dawn,"I haven't actually finished this game yet but, I""ve played enough to be able to talk about it so here it is:<br/><br/>This is an action based game with an intriguing story and  magnificant graphics. Because this is an open world game where you have plenty of space and sidequests to complete you'll find multiple machines which are actually the animals of this world. They aren't friendly so you'll either have speed through them, stealth around them or if you really want to and have the ability to: overridethem for a certain period of time 9 make them your ally). Each machine is unique as they have different abilities and weak spots for you to hit. Every time you get used to these beasts there will be a new one which will challange you yet hypnotise you with their beaty and power.<br/><br/>The game itself looks pretty darn amazing and the action isn't bad either. Mostly you use ranged weapons, like different types of bows and slingshots, but you also have a spear that can either produce a weak or a strong hit. After every mission you will get a skilll point which allows you to either unlock or upgrade yourself and your abilities: run quieter, collect more items from the robotic animals, slow down time when aiming-that's just some of them!<br/><br/>One thing that I didn""t enjoy the most was the story developping (but it could've been me as I like to take time and explore). For me, it was just a little too slow but when I played a couple of the important missions it definetly got much more interesting because you're finally unravelling what happend to humanity and why are they back in the 'stone age' or who and for what reason created the machines? <br/><br/>I would definetly recommend this to everyone and I hope that you or your friends will enjoy this beautiful game with the unique setting in the future!"
Horizon Zero Dawn,"i am currently playing "" horizen zero dawn "" and i think it is an excellent game: the graphics are realistic and the story is intresting especially when you get to the middle of the game , I really do recomend this to any gamer who likes action. <br/>                                                                   -  :)"

Grand Theft Auto IV,"So... Grand Theft Auto 4 is a big Game in itself, but what bothers me extremely about it is Windows Live! Why? Why was Windows built live with it I start GTA 4 going away (on Clo or Kitchen ...) come back from usual I expect that I am already in the Main Menu, but what is? ""Please log in to the Social Club"" and when I Then start game clicking comes the error Message ""Social Club registration failed, Please try again."" I entered password and E-mail correctly but it doesn't work! No matter GTA 4 is awesome but the Windows Live and Sacial Club thing is real schei * e! But do not recommend it. I'd rather save Money until you've had enough for GTA 5."
Grand Theft Auto IV,"When I read that the Game on Windows 8.1 is not supposed to work, I got stubborn when I Bought it. It was actually the case that the Game was not running at The start and I was forced to search the Internet for Solutions. An Estimated 2 Days it cost me to make the Game run, as I did exactly, I don't know exactly myself, because I am not a computer freak and therefore only do what different Forums have advised:D The Game itself is a Lot of Fun and you can hide with it for half an Eternity. Of Course, you can't compare the Graphics with that OF GTA 5 and the Game world is also rather measly in Contrast to the one of the ""latest"" part, but that's not supposed to diminish the Fun of The Game. Therefore, I can't complain and am absolutely happy with it for a Price of 4 (!!!) To have got euros in an Offer ^^"
Grand Theft Auto IV,"In Short: Absolute Mis-buying for me. Without the external Help of IT-Spezis, it is almost impossible for ordinary Users to walk. Support for laptop/notebook and its Gaming Graphics Cards: FEHLANZEIGE. Graphics cards with more than 2GB Of VRam are not recognized, but they can find Help in many Forums. Yes, even today you still need a GfWL account for the Game next to Steam (Now called the Microsoft account), an Account on XBox-Live (you also want to be able to save your Game?) and a Membership of Rockstar Socialclub (Prerequisite for online MPlayer).
So from because of it just buy fast, download and get started. Wishful Thinking, at least at the laptop. Anyone who tells you something else is lying to you ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ brazenly. Why Rockstar still doesn't shrug and take a Port of the Game on Steam, just as the other Studios left the GfWL have done, remains speculative to me. Why is there no Patch for the Game that is optimized with the new Generations of mobile Graphics Cards? Well, at The end of January 2015, I don't think anyone asks the Question anymore.
P.S. My negative Criticism is due solely to lousy technical implementation/Portierung/Support. The Game Content itself remains unaffected by it. Cheerz"
Grand Theft Auto IV,"Pretty good. Graphics were top notch for its time, the story is actually engaging and missions are quite fun"
Grand Theft Auto IV,"i was only a child when i played this so i did not shit myself because i was freshly potty trained. However, i gurantee if i or you played through this masterpiece again we'd both shit ourselves. 10/10"
Grand Theft Auto IV,"I was 14 when this game came out, so i was the exact target audience.  And they definitely hit the target.  Great soundtrack, truly impressive scope (for the time, not at all now), and some great writing for a video game."
Grand Theft Auto IV,"Niko Bellic and his cousin Roman, GTA IV is a true masterpiece, great story, graphics, controls, everything but one thing... the PC port, IT SUCKS! a 2008 game cannot be run without slow frames and braking bugs after a thousand updates since then."
Grand Theft Auto IV,"Grand Theft Auto 4 is a beautiful game in it's own right;  Liberty City is grimy and crime ridden.  You live in the bottom rungs of society, ignored by the upper crust except when your criminal services come in handy... you find yourself trapped in a loop of crime that seems inescapable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the game is hindered by the game engine and it's 2008 gaming philosophy.  The cars are floaty like you're driving underwater and the game camera is very low to the ground... combine that with the claustrophobic streets of Liberty City and there's few times you get to just open up the throttles and enjoy the drive.<br/><br/>The combat is also awkward and very obviously dated.<br/><br/>But the worst part:  Failing a mission is BRUTAL.  They take your guns and money, then they set you far away from the mission start.  ""Replaying"" a mission means spending time rebuying all your stuff with depleted funds and driving across the entire city to hit triggers just to try again.<br/><br/>All in all, it's got a great and engaging story mired by an old gaming philosophy.  Back in 2008 when I might have bought one game every few months this grind would have been normal.  Nowadays I've got hundreds of games at my fingertips.  I like difficult challenges, but I don't like my time wasted."
Grand Theft Auto IV,This is the best gta ever great game I actually think that this is one of the best story's ever when this game came out in 2008 it was the best looking game at that time Niko was a very awesome and unique character in the series if you watch the film behind enemy lines you will see a guy who looks exactly like Niko there is alot of things I wish they would have done with the game like add car customizing you can paint your car but sometimes it takes a long time to get the color you want definitely has some of the best soundtracks in gaming the fighting is fantastic I can go around for 2 hours straight fighting people in this game the shooting is the same way very addictive the ragdoll physics are awesome super satisfying gta 4 hands down beats gta5 for all I just said except for car customizing and graphics great game if you haven't played I highly recommend you do so and also the police aren't as brutal as in gta5 and the AI aren't as good of shots either which is awesome but just talking about this game makes me want to go back and play it.
Grand Theft Auto IV,"Grand Theft Auto IV is kind of a reboot for Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto series.  Technically this game is the first in the “HD” universe of Grand Theft Auto games. I am unaware if these recent games (including GTA V) exist in the same universe as the old Grand Theft Auto games, but I highly doubt it as these games seem to be more connected to each other as opposed to older games that are merely referenced in easter eggs and not outright referenced by a line of dialogue or something more concrete. But I digress. GTA IV centers on Niko Bellic a war hero and immigrant from Eastern Europe as he tries to find a new life in America and contend with the criminal element that can either help or kill him. The game is in itself an immigrant story of sorts. There is a lot of diversity that is reflected in the game, both in aesthetic and the open world design as well as the stories and missions. This is seemingly reflective of the reality of New York City, which is the basis for the setting of this game. The game follows the struggles and hardships that immigrants face when placed in the overbearing culture and boundless opportunity that America is known for. The city, Liberty City, is based on New York City. There are four boroughs that are modeled on the four boroughs of New York City. Something that always comes to mind for me is how decadent and disgusting the city appears. I don’t expect New York to be this clean shiny city, but this game really goes out of its way to show how nasty this city is (both physically and perhaps culturally and socially due to the characters and actions that are depicted in the game). The gameplay is really good. Few games really capture driving mechanics as well as GTA does. Most games kind of pull a Saints Row where the driving mechanics feel so weightless and nonexistent. The gunplay and physics are good, especially for 2008.  However, some of the movement mechanics are rather clunky. The graphics are severely dated, it’s not distracting but it’s definitely a product of its time. But textures and  the rendering in this game is really bad, oddly enough I think Red Dead Redemption shares that element as well, sadly, I will pay attention when I play through it to see if this is the case. The game is vast with plenty of things to do and immerse yourself in. Not as much as say, Red Dead Redemption II or GTA V, but it’s enough to be annoying and not overwhelming. For instance, the supporting characters can have closer relationships with Niko if he spends time with them, so that leads to the annoying bombardment  of your ingame cellphone with suggestions and invitations by other characters to go grab a drink or go bowling or engage in the numerous activities featured in the game. That gets annoying. Also, it’s really annoying to complete a mission, call the mission provider to inform him or her that you completed the mission only for you to tap X or A to speed up walking a bit, or to get shot at by a police officer or a criminal which cancels that action. The police in this game are so annoying.  The voice acting in the game is very good. Rockstar has the tendency to cast quality voice actors that no one has ever heard of, or at least I haven’t heard of and I like to think that I keep up with films and other mediums. While flawed, this game is definitely a must play for anyone. It hasn’t aged well for me, but it doesn’t diminish the overall quality of the game.<br/><br/>Rating: 4.5/5"
Grand Theft Auto IV,"The game has a great story, great and well-built characters, a badass protagonist, game mechanics are really good besides some bad things here and there (well, even GTA V have its)."
Grand Theft Auto IV,"I finally revisited the series since I played San Andreas ten years ago! GTA IV is a good game, and it's definitely worth your time even if you are a Japanese indie-strategy lover or worse. I won't touch upon the subjects that was discussed through and through such as the gameplay (you kill and steal, duh) or the soundtrack (brilliant and authentic as always) or anything like that.<br/><br/>My personal experince was that in this GTA I really loved shooting. Never before assaults in the series have felt so good. Which is probably why there are lots of missions involving assaults in some form. The weapons felt different and guns make you change the playing style. This was the first game where I loved to shoot the pistol, the weapon that is usually regarded as the lamest one. Mastering the pistol is very rewarding in some sense, because when you finish storming the building full of gangsters wielding AK47s or M16s, you feel like a bad ass antihero that Niko really is.<br/><br/>In some sense, the game is truer-to-life than San Andreas, since there are no jetpacks or easily-stealable tanks or spy-planes. In some sense, it is not, since you can't work out to fight or run more effectively and you can't put on weight either.<br/><br/>As for the story, I demote the overall score from Exceptional to Recommended because of it. The story is sometimes not logical and sometimes too predictive (something like a bad action B-movie), some really interesting characters that you meet don't develop at all and die quickly. In this sense GTA IV really make you revisit Liberty City, since GTA III also suffered from the bad story (but it was kinda the first game in the series, so it was justifiable back then)."

Rocket League,"The Game is very good.
There's the rather exotic Sport of the Car ball, which is similar to Football. In Germany, it was made known by Stefan Raab. Two Groups of Cars/Motorists have to bugger a huge Ball into the opponent's goal.
Rocket League (RL) takes up this Game idea and implements it quite ingeniously electronically, adding many Variants to this Principle.
The most common Variant Of the Game is a Football-like game in a Football-like Arena. However, this is completely surrounded by Walls and a Ceiling, all of which are passable. The Corners are rounded, so the Vehicles, as well as the Ball, don't corner anywhere.
The Learning Curve in this Game is quite steep. The Tutorial is highly recommended. But You will also notice what Art it is. As long as all the Participants are about the same, it's a lot of Fun. From a very simple Way of Playing (as you might know it from the real Car stop) to Acrobats of the Skies (yes, the Cars can fly), which leave your Mouth open, everything is conceivable.
You can both perform private Matches (i.e. play with Friends, one makes the Host and invites), using Bots (stupid, heavy or saucid) or public Matches, with the game picking the Opponents. Here you can compete as a Team closed or join a Team as a Single Player. It is possible to 1vs1 to 4vs4.
However, this Match finding is not without Pitfalls and the Main Problem that can spoil the Fun. The right Match finding is certainly a very complex Problem and I understand that this is not easy to program or implement. Since Games limited Waiting Times, Ping, predetermined Team Formations and everything else might still play a Role.
The Problem, though, is that you often hit far better players in Matches ranked And technically, against whom you have little Chance, which can be very frustrating, especially if you're the Weaker one in a Team. Since the Rounds usually only last 5 Minutes, you can still go in search of a thrilling Match.
For a change, there are also other Game variants, Ice Hockey and Basketball, for example, as well as different Arenas and different Settings with the use of Power-Ups or the Effect of Contacts.
The Cars can be spiced up before the Game starts, but this is all purely visual and decorative (probably also the Shape of the Car).
You can also spend a lot of extra Money in the Game, but there is no Pay To Win. Even the ""Lootboxes,"" which costs more than 1 Euro to open, do not offer any important Advantages for playing.
Still, if you're not exactly a pro, the Game will be the most Fun with Friends versus Friends. The Game idea is so entertaining that you can probably play it again and again.
The Graphics I think are very good for such a multiplayer title with such a high Pace of play. Only if you really have nothing to do and look at the Area could you stumble across some Backdrops from ""Cardboard.""
The Sound is apt, the Control with Controller is fairly simple (technically, running the Ball well is an Art).
There are a lot of Achievements for which you have to do something.
Pro &amp; Contra: + An ingenious Game idea + Entertaining Matches, especially with Teamchat + Very nice Graphics o Very much entertaining Frills (E.g. for the optical Upgrade of the Vehicles)-The Level rise is somewhat problematic:--It is only tied to Points, not In real deeper ""skills""--He's permanent (no matter how many times you play RL)-Match-finding Public Matches can be problematic--You soon encounter players who play far better and the demotivated Standings: 9/10 A real entertaining Ball Game especially with Friends versus Friends or Bots.
If you have the appropriate Ambitions and Talents, playing a Part In the public Games can also Be fun in the long term."

Cyberpunk 2077,Having played release and now on 1.6 the difference is night and day. This Game really shines now the bugs have been ironed out and the story is a genuine joy to play. If you never played it at release I urge anyone who was interested to give it a go now as this is now the experience we all wished we had at release.
Cyberpunk 2077,"I have no idea why everyone rated this game ""exceptional"" but sure isn't. The story might be ""good"" but the gameplay is bad, repetitive and boring asf. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone but of course, this is just my opinion."
Cyberpunk 2077,"<div>I started playing a long time after release and I didn't experience many issues. I saw a car flip into the air for no reason, that was fun. I had to clear out all enemies from an area and one of them was in the group, that was not so fun. Ultimately, I enjoyed running around Night City and meeting some interesting characters. I didn't much like the FPS style combat and didn't feel like my character upgrades were doing much of anything. <br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Date Completed: 2022-08-21 <br/></div><div>Playtime: 30h <br/></div><div>Enjoyment: 7/10 <br/></div><div>Recommendation: It's no Witcher but, at this point, I think it's worth a run through.</div>"
Cyberpunk 2077,"I was really not expecting to like this game as much as I did. From the first major mission setting up the main storyline I was on board and everything after was just a great ride. There were a lot of great side missions with a good handful of some fun detective work in a few. There are great companion characters that you will grow to love. Judy is one of my favorite game characters now with her awesome story arc and great VO performance. Speaking of VO, female V was incredible. That actor gave an incredible performance and nailed all the emotion she needed to convey in her scenes. Gameplay is fun but nothing special. It's very fun to just dice people up with mantis blades. I know this game had a hell of a rocky start but after the patch I encountered almost no bugs or crashes and just enjoyed the story and the world as I think they intended. I really hope others had as good of a time as I did with it."
Cyberpunk 2077,"It just didn't come together right. It's not that the game is low quality, but there is no real spirit that would make this game exceptional."
Cyberpunk 2077,"alright i know what im supposed to say about this game and what i actually feel about it are 2 different things so im just gonna tell you what i actually feel about the game but it must stay between me and you. I shit myself not once, not twice, not even three times. I played and shit myself 4 times in this game and each time i felt like a new character in a fresh new anime. Thats until you pass the intro for each lifepath of course but the gameplay is fun each time. 9/10, not a masterpiece but my god it is fun"
Cyberpunk 2077,"I know how everyone suffered but I finished this game without bugs and I loved this game. It has a lot of problem, a lot of expected features missing but still it made me play it. This game is most immersive game I've ever played and probably it will stay like this. Night City is best looking city in a video game world, I wish that it felt more alive too. Even driving a car in that city is an experience you should taste. Most underrated part is writing of this game. Main story is not original but side quests and characters are amazing. I believe everyone should play this game, at least when it is playable to everyone. "
Cyberpunk 2077,"Cyberpunk 2077 portrays a hyper-capitalist future where megacorporations have beyond the capacity of governments to control them, creating a dystopian world. Everything is for sale; nothing is protected. Dedication to this environment is what makes Cyberpunk a wonderful success story.

Cyberpunk 2077,"Buggy as hell, not even close to what it was supposed to be, unforgettable experience, loved (almost) every minute."
Cyberpunk 2077,"TW // Suicide<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/><br/>Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that seemed to be doomed on release, what with the many delays, the onslaught of bugs and glitches, previous-gen consoles running the game like a progerian. So much backlash against the game put onto lists of the worst games of 2020, and even with CD Projekt Red getting sued by their sponsors I still came out of this game loving it to the high heavens.<br/><br/>With a nice blend of GTA style gameplay with RPG style leveling systems and questing, Cyberpunk 2077 takes you through an emotional downfall of your character V trying to make it in Night City but after one bad heist ends up with proclaimed rock legend Johnny Silverhand, voiced by Keanu Reeves, overwriting her brain and you have to try to figure out how to stop it by having various interactions with the different Night City gangs, teaming up with the big corporation Arasaka, and ultimately coming to a six-pronged fork in the road with various choices on how you the player would like to go out.<br/><br/>The side missions are overall pretty great. The NCDP dispatches, Assault in Progress', Fixer jobs, and Cyberpscyho Sightings all play out like radiant quests with a limit and at a certain point they can get kind of tedious, but there's so much compacted into Night City that getting to and from each job isn't much of a hassle.. until you get to the Badlands where the spacing is at it's absolute worse having hundreds of km between each job which is where I started finding them to get really tiring.<br/><br/>There's a handful of romanceable characters with their own stories that I found to be pretty entertaining. I really only cared about romancing with Judy and Panam, but sadly the game cucked me from Panam because I decided to play as a female V but nonetheless I had a lot of fun going through the different characters and watching them progress and gain these relationships.<br/><br/>And of course, you can't talk about Cyberpunk 2077 without mentioning the absolute absurdity of Johnny Silverhand being voiced by Keanu Reeves. The relationship you grow with this character throughout the game is phenomenal. Starting off with you two hating each other guts to soon enough letting him take control of your body so he can try to fuck his ex from 50 years ago to which he blue balls him right before he's about to stick it in. I find myself gravitating towards the side character that makes comments about what's going on, and that's one of the purposes that Johnny holds. Think Joker in Arkham Knight. The gameplay was already an immense amount of fun and the story is captivating, but the extra frosting of hearing Keanu make sarcastic comments about everything or insult my cock just makes the Night City experience all the greater.<br/><br/>One last thing I wanna discuss is the endings. As said before, there are about 6 different ways that you can end the game, and I played through 5 of them. I would've gone for the secret 6th ending but I fucked up a dialogue route with Johnny earlier in the game and I honestly don't have the drive to replay the entire game and rebuild my character after putting 90 hours into this game, but I digress. The different endings you have are<br/><br/>1) V takes over her body but will only have 6 months to live due to her body rejecting her code and accepting Johnnys.<br/>2) Johnny takes over V's body and lives his life.<br/>3) V takes over her body but will only have 6 months to live due to her body rejecting her code and accepting Johnnys... but with the addition of living the rest of her life with Judy, Panam, and the rest of the Aldecaldos clan.<br/>4) Let Arasaka deal with the problem to which a bunch of wild shit happens in space and soon you're given the decision to either stay with the Arasaka and become part of their coded program or go back to earth and die soon later.<br/>5) Commit suicide.<br/>6) Invade Arasaka with Johnny, basically a suicide run.<br/><br/>Now I could go on about each and every ending that I was able to play, but I'll sum up my thoughts quickly for the first 4. V taking over her body is a really sad and lonely ending which I actually like how it's not happy. Johnny taking over is sweet, wholesome, and emotional. The best way I can describe it is melancholic. V living with the Aldecaldos is without a doubt the best ending in the game because she gets to spend the rest of her short-lived life with her friends and family. Teaming up with the Arasaka is like a Twilight Zone episode and the ending that I have the least amount of feelings on.<br/><br/>Now for the suicide ending, an ending that's deemed as ""The Bad Ending"" but I personally don't. I find it more, the beautiful ending. Coming from someone who's has a history with the topic both personally and being around people with their own personal history, the way the devs wrote this ending is absolutely perfect. After watching the camera pan away from V and Johnny sitting together starring out to Night City, you hear a gunshot and the credits start rolling. Now, with every ending you get certain characters that have a response to the kind of ending you chose, so with this particular ending each character displays the exact different type of reaction to a close one committing suicide. Vik feels regret, Judy is demolished, Panam is furious, Kelly goes on a rant about suicide being glorified, and finally Rivers and Misty accept it, with Rivers telling a story of when his cop buddy killing himself and ending the message wishing that V is living a better life. Misty talks a bit is surprisingly relaxed about the entire thing and understands your decision, and then ends off with wishing that hopefully one day you, her, and Jackie can all meet up in the afterlife. It's an ending that genuinely left me emotional and speechless at how beautifully they handled the topic<br/><br/>Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 is an emotional ride of marvelous beauty and easily grew to be one of my favorite games that I have ever had the joy to play. Of course, I had my bugs and glitches but none of them were ever game-breaking, just really funny which having a history with Bethesda games makes these random moments where the game doesn't work properly actually up the enjoyment for me. I wholeheartedly believe that Cyberpunk 2077 deserves a second chance and I hope eventually video game culture will ease the fuck up and come to terms with what happened and decide to pick up this game because I recommend it heavily. Especially on Xbox Series X because that's what I played it on and like I said, didn't really experience anything game-breaking.

Cyberpunk 2077,"Played it on PC. Loved almost every second, besides bugs and technical issues. Solid gameplay, interesting storylines (especially in side quests) and one of the best characters in video games. Visuals are stunning with rtx and maxed out details. <br/><br/>On contra, the city is not very reactiv and more like a stage for the story and characters. It can't be compared to a GTA. <br/><br/>9.5/10"
Cyberpunk 2077,"This review is spoiler free.
<br/><br/>The reason why you should take your time and wait for this game to be properly patched, is that Cyberpunk 2077 has a lot of potential for the future to stand in the same line with the best open-world games in this industry. For now it's an unfinished product that gained success as a money making machine but it failed in delivering a polished work that would meet the expectations with the hype surrounding it. Lack of marketing deliberation and overgrowth of ambition are just the top of the iceberg that I won't explore over here. Instead, I will concentrate on the gameplay-only aspects.<br/><br/>Main character of the Cyberpunk 2077 is V - a street mercenary who desires to earn reputation and become a legend of Night City. Despite of already having certain personality (that we can't change or modify) developers didn't wanted to give us a character made from A to Z; instead they gave us an opportunity to choose V's background, attributes and appearance. It resembles very much creating Shepard in Mass Effect series. Chosing a background (corpo, nomad or street kid) will reflect on your prologue mission, it will affect few dialogues just a little bit and give you other type of clothes for the beginning but it won't make a big change on your overall gameplay; after the first unique mission for each class (which lasts maximum 25 minutes) all three lifepaths will continue the same story. Defining V's background is more about picking an identity that will suit your role-playing style the most, but nothing beyond that. After chosing your class, you get to dispatch 7 points for your attributes: body, intelligence, reflexes, technical abilities and cool. Each attribute is divided to few subcategories where we can pick specific skills at the cost of perk points that we get through three possible ways: leveling up, skill progression or through finding perk shards in the game world. The skill tree should be more lucid in my opinion, but once we will start to get any ideas in which direction we want to build our character it should make more sense. There are few interesting options: melee based sneaking character (cool + body), direct approach riflemen (reflex), hackers desintegrating enemies from safe distance (intelligence), engineers who craft powerful items and lockpick all the doors (technical) and other mixed variations between them that you can make to your liking. Be careful though: it won't be possibile to master all the skills in the game, and the maximum level of progression that you can reach is 50, so you should be concentrated on what kind of build you want to make. After deciding which attributes are the most important for your V, you will start working on the visual aspect of your character. We get enough of tools to create something original, yet not so much as most of us would expect. The promise of changing the size of V's penis could stimulate imagination of some people, but when it comes to body creation, Saints Row 2 from 2008 was way more complex on that matter. You shouldn't expect much but just enough. You can choose a voice (one for a male and one for a female), one out of 39 haircuts, beard type, skin type and its tone, eyes and eyebrows, nose, mouth, jaw, ears, visual cyberwares, piercing, tattoos, scars, make-up, teeth, nails, nipples etc. It seems like a pretty good base for making something original, yet you still can't change things like age (V is always 28 years old), body type (fat or muscular) and variety of tattoos or piercings is pretty low. You won't see V's face too often during your gameplay anyway; it's always FPP with no third person perspective available like in new Fallouts, which means that the only chance to see V's appearance will be by approaching to the mirror (which has to be turned on because there is no mirror reflections in the game), by using photo mode or by watching the ending cutscenes. If you don't want to spend too much time in character creator or you can't make anything interesting by yourself, you can always hit random button; it's pretty messy, since the creation algorythm randomizes every customizable part of your characters body and face, but after removing piercing, make ups, tattoos and scars you should get some cool results after few moments of trying. Watch out: once you confirm your V's appearance, you can't change any part of it in the game - there's no tattoo parlours, no barbers, no pedicures or manicures to be made. It's a missing feature that should be updated in the future, but for now it isn't, so make sure that your male nomad V doesn't have pink nails or crazy tattoos on his body or you will continue with it until the very end of the game.
<br/><br/>The introduction to Night City - the main area of Cyberpunk 2077 - starts with a prologue unique for each one of the classes. In my opinion, the way that the game world was presented to us in a such story-focused game could have been done better; the introductions usually are the best moments to create element of surprise, to shock or either to take a slow-paced approach to build a tension that arouses curiosity. Entering to Night City should be a BIG thing, especially for nomads who start their journey at the desert environement of Badlands, yet things escalates so quickly that it seems like no one really has paid too much attention to importance of such introduction. You can feel that there is a significant part of script that's missing, and it's a pity, because the prologue mission of street kid was so well directed that with a little more time of work it could easily fill the emptiness I felt at the start. I think that the problem lays in the cutscene that you can watch after first 25 minutes of gameplay which presents V doing all kinds of stuff that YOU should be allowed to do: hanging out, making contacts and meeting people, getting things done, earning rep. Instead, the storyline skips all of this and suddenly it takes us forward in time 6 months later to Japantown, where you will have a messy task to do. That is the moment where things are starting to get bizzare - and a player still has absolutely no idea about it. The prologue presents to us gameplay mechanics that don't exist after reaching to act 2. Few examples. Our first mission in Japantown is the only place where we will find a breakable wall - the game will allow you later to shoot through obstacles with power weapons, but no object in the game can be truly destroyed in the same manner. It is also one of the very few moments in the game when we will have a possibility of participating in a drive-by shooting from a passenger seat, which is nothing more than a scripted shooting-on-rails part of the mission, despite from what the tutorial hint of ""vehicle combat"" appearing on the screen is trying to tell us; it's not a tool that we will be allowed to use later in the game. Also, our first visit to the ripperdoc will show us few animations of installing implants, but during your future visits there you will see nothing more than a shopping cart on your screen. But out of all these things, the most important matter of prologue exceptionality is that it appears to be the only part of the whole story where dialogues really seem to have an effect on the final course of action; you will realize that during your first big assignment from a fixer and your first mission with Maelstrom that there are multiple ways of solving a questline. It's not only one of the best missions in the entire game but it's also one with the biggest variety of outcomes depending from our actions. That's right - the most complex quest in the game appears in the prologue, which means that as the story will progress there won't be more missions alike! Gameplay exceptions like this creates a problem: it hypes you for a specific kind of experience that you expect to see when Cyberpunk's open world will be finally available to discover, but when you will reach act 2 and complete few missions here and there you will feel that something is missing. After putting some thought into it I realized that the reason why prologue presented all these unique mechanics was not just for the idea of introducing the world of Cyberpunk 2077 to the players, but most importantly for marketing reasons. The events from act 1 were presented by CD Project RED in their famous 48 minute gameplay reveal. Of course, as usual, the trailers are supposed to show what's the best to attract the attention of consumers and build a hype - and that is exactly why such materials should be approached with caution as they are overestimating the actual condition of the game - but I think that at this point we are touching the subject of false marketing or - to be more polite - a lack of deliberation. I can't recall any other game in the history that would have more agressive marketing than Cyberpunk 2077.<br/><br/>Finishing the prologue starts the act 2 which will present to us completely open world of Cyberpunk 2077 - the Night City and the Badlands. With the world at our feet, we can go out and explore it - and it takes some time until we start to get a hang of its topography. The game world is pretty big and it easily stands in the same line with the biggest sandbox AAA games such as Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim or Fallout New Vegas. It delivers one of the most detailed open worlds known in the game history, and the developers have done tremendous amount of work when it comes to building a distinctive for the genre atmosphere through Night City's complexity. I haven't been that amazed by gargantuanness of a cyberpunk megacity since seeing Hengsha from Deus Ex: Human Revolution for the first time in 2011. I think that CD Project Red deserved great words of appreciation for showing us a future dystopian metropolis not through dark, rainy and other sci-fi well-worn visual patterns with ""the sky [...] that was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel"" but through a rich palette of colors emanating from the lights, neons, megascreens and holograms elevating above the city. Its districts differs from each other on the levels of architecture, social classes, fashion, quality of technology and cars driving through their areas. The game world designers were basing their work on few art styles such as kitsch, neo-kitsch, entropism and neo-militarism. You can adapt to the flow by establishing your own fashion style, or you can just travel on the streets of Night City and enjoy the variety of different areas: Cherry Blossom Market in Japantown with it's asian restaurants and gaming parlors; industrial part of Watson filled with Maelstrom gang members who seem to exercise Franz Rottensteiner's rule of high-tech and low-life with their cybernetically upgraded to the limit bodies; area of City Center serving as headquarters of corporations with its skyscrapers and splendor; the wastelands of Badlands surrounded by nomads driving in their Mad Max inspired vehicles. Even the view of the junkyard - and the size of it - near Santo Domingo can be astonishing. The attention to details in all of these locations is praiseworthy. We can't enter to all buildings in Night City, but when we do, we will realize that it's hard to find two look-alike locations, which is a common problem in games with open world. It is not perfect though - I admire the magnificence of the in-game world, but it has a strange and uneasy feeling of emptiness arriving from time to time. The reason of it lies in few things. One of those that I really hated was that sometimes the game engine was incapable of rendering crowds on the streets and in effect the city looked literally empty! Restarting the game usually was solving the problem but - unfortunately - not always. Some districts are just vacant and while for some areas it might be justified because of the high rates of crime activity (like Pacifica), this aspect just seems to be underdeveloped. The other reason behind the sense of emptiness of the Night City is... Radio stations. I know that it might be hard to believe - as the soundtrack in this game is amazing - but radio stations are in 99% just music. Sounds even more crazy? Then listen to no matter any radio stations from Grand Theft Autos and then check out any radio from Cyberpunk 2077. The difference is huge: in GTA - just like in the real world - the speakers talking all kinds of stuff, interrupting music with annoucing name of the track actually playing, agressive noises of product placement, commercials, news - it all makes driving through the city way more interesting and simultaneously it brings life to the streets. This aspect of the game, if properly done, could change very much in the overall experience of exploration. I really wish that radio stations could be done with the same pietism as in Grand Theft Auto series. I think that in creating open worlds like this CD Project Red could learn a lot from Rockstar Games and radio stations is definitely one of the aspects that the Reds should work on in the future. Apart from those that I already mentioned, there are few more ways of reducing the sense of emptiness; exploration of the city and the desert surrounding it could be more fun if developers would allow players to immerse themselves in the game world by doing side activities in town, such as hanging out with friends, eating, drinking, clubbing, bowling as Grand Theft Auto games allowed us since GTA San Andreas. In Cyberpunk when you go clubbing and want to order a drink at the bar, you will see a shopping cart on the screen - and it immediately throws you out of the flow. Considering the magnificent architecture of Night City, lack of immersing tools in it is one of the biggest missing features which prevents us from experiencing it more fully. In effect, exploring the game world concentrates for 90% of the time around driving from one mission to another and nothing beyond that. Cyberpunk 2077 is still far from the level of simulation reached by GTA IV and GTA V. Maybe in future games from CD Project RED we will have a chance of enjoying a more deep gameplay.
<br/><br/>The best way to get around Night City is to drive one of the 54 vehicles available: sports cars, economy class vehicles, motorbikes, trucks etc. I especially liked the esthetics of nomad type of rides, so Mizutani Shion ""Coyote"" was my first pick and I am pretty sure that everyone will find something that will match their taste. The thing that made great impression on me was not only beauty of vehicle design on the outside but also inside them. Car cockpits are made with fantastic attention to details and I enjoyed driving in a first person perspective very much even if it's not my preferable view in racing games. For your creativity at designing vehicles in Cyberpunk 2077, I say chapeau bas, CD Project Red, BUT I have a big problem with car purchasing system. I don't know who came up with this idea and why it was implemented, but on the world map all cars and motorbikes available to buy are marked as side-quests... It creates an unnecessary mess when you're trying to filter map legend to figure out what should be your next move. System of buying cars in this game really seems like a last minute attempt to make it function and it was made quickly because nothing else was working, so they left it like that because they couldn't waste more of their production time. Who knows how many other aspects of the game were treated the same way? We can only guess. As for the driving system itself, I think that it should be toned down as the sensibility of handling makes our car turning too sharp. There is no need to expect from a story-driven RPG to be trying to implement Colin McRae Rally mechanics, and honestly there is no need to be changing that much. Actually - ironically speaking - sharp handling might be actually pretty useful at this point, since minimap during fast driving is zoomed so much that we will always miss a turn. It often ends in making u-turns and it's one of the most annoying features in the game that should be repaired as quick as it can; it lead me to a point where I turned the minimap off to be more focused on the traffic. Funny thing is that when I did it, while driving through more vacant locations of Night City I realized that the game engine keeps rendering artificial traffic in the far distance. It is especially highly visible during fast driving on the highways or Badlands and it wouldn't be a problem with more dense of real traffic. If at any moment of the game you will feel tired of driving - which shouldn't happen often anyway - there's a possibility of fast travel, but considering the amount of jobs that you can do in Night City I don't think that it will be necessary. <br/><br/>The world map is full of filler-quests of the same nature as question marks from Witcher 3, Far Cry series or Assassin's Creed. Majority of them are contracts for fixers who want you to steal a valuable object, hack computers of their enemies, kill someone, neutralise people sick of cyberpsychosis (Blade Runner vibes) or proceed a rescue mission; all of them starts with a phone call from a fixer who explains the nature of the contract and then sends you a message with all the details attached. Purpose of such missions is the same as always: earning experience, money and respect, and while most of them are just time fillers, the star of Cyberpunk 2077 shines its brightest light where the main plot and side quests lies. To avoid unnecessary spoilers I will keep it simple, and say that the main story focuses around a biochip which works as a storage for human personality - it's an obvious reference  to mind constructs from William Gibson's ""Neuromancer"" and their subject will be deeply explored as the story progresses. It will also touch the subject of cyberspace, immortality, AI, human sex-dolls (reference to Gibson's meat puppets), braindancing (experiencing someone else's feelings through virtual reality) and many other aspects known in the cyberpunk genre. There is also another thing that has to be taken into consideration when we talk about great scenario and it is phenomenal character design. Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the games that presents a great variety of characters so different not only on their superficial level but most importantly through their personality. We will get to know them more through dialogues, and these are of the same quality as all The Witcher games which is a good thing on one side and a bad one on another. The good side is that dialogues are well written and the voice actors have done their best to express the emotions of their characters (even an actor of one face such as Keanu Reeves). The bad side is that we won't have much conversation lines to choose comparing to other RPGs (like Fallout New Vegas or Mass Effect) and their outcome mostly stays the same; the only thing that differs is the NPC reaction to our words, but after this, the conversation follows it's linear script. Unfortunately, after prologue, the dialogues seem to be losing their importance.
<br/><br/>To complete your tasks in the world of Cyberpunk 2077 you can take different approaches as you like. If you're a sneaking type, the game allows you to avoid enemy encounters, hack security cameras and silently neutralising your enemies, reaching your target, and then going out unseen through air shafts or rooftops like in a good immersive-sim, so fans of Deus Ex games or Dishonored should be excited for it. Unfortunately, sneaking mechanics are still underdeveloped and have to be patched. You will easy get thrown out of immersion when your character will just suddenly stand up on it's own and get quickly exposed which usually causes a carnage and more often our instant death (especially on the hardest difficulty). To hide your activity in enemy area you can carry bodies of unconsious enemies. Problem is that by leaving them on the floor the game often kills them, treating them as if they had fallen from a great height - it may be a problem for a pacifist kind of players, so remember to make tactical quicksaves often because there is still a lot of work to be done here. Another approach is just open combat with firearms or melee weapons. Gunplay in Cyberpunk 2077 is the same you know from Borderlands, The Outer Worlds or Fallouts; not only the enemies but your character too are nothing more but sponges for bullets and the difference between living and dying in this world lies in precision of your attacks (aim for the headshots) and in the quality of armor you're wearing. We have to remember that Cyberpunk 2077 is an RPG and it is a genre that has it's flaws when it comes to keeping right pace of the combat. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if people found out that they like it; it's a matter of personal preference. Personally I don't like the bullet-sponge gunplay style; I liked more of a static combat known from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Dying Light. The reason why I am not a fan of such mechanics is because they often lead to bizzare situations on the screen. Surviving rocket fire or shotgun blast in the chest from close distance is one thing, but I find it quite an abuse when we are unloading a whole magazine of bullets to an enemy sprinting in our direction with a melee weapon and despite our precision and headshots, he still manages to reach us with 5HP left and he kills us with two hits of a baseball bat. At this point I think that we can deny AI's self-preservation instinct. Oh, speaking of AI? Right...<br/><br/>Artificial intelligence of NPC's in Cyberpunk 2077 is a misunderstanding. Lack of self-preservation instinct is just a beginning. Small word of advise: stay away from the police. The wanted script is a mess; no matter where will you hide, the police will get to you. You can even try to barricade yourself in the basement with power weapons - the police officers will magically spawn behind you and quickly put you to the ground. High speed chases with law enforcements? You have to forget about it. AI driving script is pretty bad too.<br/><br/>For now, Cyberpunk 2077 in its current state (version 1.12) is far away from what we were supposed to get. The marketing machine behind it promised the players way too much and set for this game a difficult challenge to meet the expectations of the immersive, open world gameplay. Promises lead to expectations and expectations often lead to dissapointment. The matter of agressive marketing of Cyberpunk 2077 proves a lack of deliberation, which combined with the fact that we have recieved an unfinished product is absolutely unacceptable. Despite of over 8 million pre-orders sold - which is pretty impressive - I have to argue with the idea of calling this game success.

Cyberpunk 2077,"This came could've been so much more, it's a true example of how ""A rushed game is never good"". You can see it's unfinished, unpolished, and full of limitations in areas that a game that promised so much should never have. I still enjoyed every minute of it, I played through the story, I grew attached to the characters, and I think the story is the one thing where this game didn't fail to deliver. It's different, it's new, it's compelling, it got me wanting to play more and to find out what was going to happen. I went for 100% completion and I don't regret it. I wish things had been better for Cyperpunk. "
Cyberpunk 2077,"<div>No Spoilers - A great game with an amazing emotional story which lacks in both length &amp; structure which almost feels overwhelming with so much to do and so much grinding for progression to gain more strength.

Cyberpunk 2077,"The biggest disappointment in gaming history without a doubt. I am truly baffled how anyone could ever defend this steaming pile of crap. Shallow story, shallow characters, more bugs than Fallout 76, braindead AI, horrendous game designs, messy UI, godawful loot system, and worst of all, the lies. CDPR took all the good will I had towards them with The Witcher 3 and they destroyed all of that in less than 2 days worth of playtime. I was in denial at first, firmly believing it to be a 7/10 with bugs, but at this point, and especially after the Crowbcat video, I cannot possibly defend this game. The lies again, are the biggest insult this game has to offer. I feel truly sorry for the devs who did their best but had to give in to the greedy and incompetent higher ups at CDPR. I don't care if all the bugs are fixed in the future, I am never going back to this game. This has left a bad taste in my mouth that will never go away and I doubt I will ever support CDPR again. "
Cyberpunk 2077,"Since I only had really few bugs and I play on PC full ultra, I really think the graphics are insane, the storymode is incredible, the whole Night City is fantastic and the soundtrack is perfect.<br/>It's that kind of game that you play all day long without realize. And I love it."

Cyberpunk 2077,"I'll just be sincere here, the game is fantastic. But it feels unfinished.<br/><br/>It has many good points. I could stay the whole day talking about it, but I'll keep to what I enjoyed most/what I saw in the first runs. The city is gigantic and mesmerizing like a lamp for insects. Lots of hidden things for you to look for. The campaign has a lot of cool and memorable characters like Judy, Panam, Johnny himself, they are very well built and their side quests I ended up liking more than the main one. The game universe itself is very large and with this game we are seeing only a fraction of it. You have your own apartment, gun stash, cell phone to talk to. You can totally modify yourself by following perk builds and body modifications for agi / int / str and that I found very cool. I suffered a lot to get the hang of it and choose the right points. Money comes reasonably easy to buy the best things. You can buy many different cars, and it's really nice to be inside them and see it all modeled.<br/><br/>But yeah, the game feels unfinished. And it is. The whole southern part of the map looks like it has nothing. Lots of features missing, like metro for example, a decent AI system. There was a lack of a system to improve the look (clothes, change the appearance of the character, arms, legs, etc.), the same with vehicles and guns, even your own apartment. Those are details that really make a difference and make the gameplay a unique experience, and I hope they add those in the future (if not, please modders hear my plea). Many things are useless or have little impact such as the reward system for example. The decisions in the dialogues do not affect the game as much as I expected. The quests have some very well elaborated and polished while others feels just whatever. Even the Braindance, they sold it so much on their previews and you see so little in the game.<br/><br/>Even with all that, I feel in love with the game. The bugs didn't really bother me, every game has it. It just feels unfinished. But I find it promising. CD sold a lot and it was not possible to do everything they wanted, or everything they promised, in that sense it disappointed me a little, but it didn't irritate me, it doesn't detract from what the game is. The problem is that they themselves promised a lot, and did not deliver due to time. But hey, CD is giving feedback, apologizing and being committed to improve, so let's wait and see the improvments on the way.<br/><br/>TL;DR: Fantastic game, but it is unfinished. If you believe this is a futuristic three letter game, stick to the old."
Cyberpunk 2077,A big let down. Many promises that the CDPR does not keep. I don't really care about the bugs if the game is what they promoted all these years.
Cyberpunk 2077,"'Cyberpunk 2077' is a game which has had an enormous impact on the gaming industry. That be its initial announcement back in 2012, the famous Keanu Reeves reveal at E3 2019, or its three major delays throughout 2020. The game also experienced a huge amount of negative press on launch in December 2020 with its many issues, bugs and glitches, ultimately resulting in Sony removing the title from its very own Playstation Store.  A game like this only comes every so often. The last title I can think that had such an impact is most likely 'Red Dead Redemption II' or 'Grand Theft Auto V'. <br/><br/>Regardless of what events came before or after the release of 'Cyberpunk 2077', the most important thing the game needs to demonstrate is that it is worth playing. To put it simply, yes this game is worth your time. It is also a game that has been significantly hyped, and for the quality of a game it is, I can confirm that this game does not meet the hype it had generated. <br/><br/>Let's start with the good things 'Cyberpunk 2077' does as there are many outstanding features which the game has to offer. Firstly, the open-world environment of the game is truly incredible. The verticality of the city and its design is something I have never quite seen before. Highways dominate the streetscape, above and below, skyscrapers tower over the city and create this ultra-dystopian world where social class can clearly be seen by who occupies the high and low regions of the game's world. It was awesome to see so many buildings in the game be completely accessible by the player. Likewise, it was very impressive to see how the richness of every interior and exterior environment in the game. Markets, for instance, were always buzzing with food, people and activities. People in these environments interacted and ultimately made the world of the game feel incredibly real and liveable. It was also great to have such variation in the environments you could explore in the game. No one area felt the same as the other. I should also mention the level of detail put into the lighting featured throughout the game. Spaces are lit with a huge selection of stunning colours and shades. It is honestly remarkable the level of detail 'Cyberpunk 2077' has to offer. The strong graphics in the game reflect this level of detail extremely well. In particular, facial animation and character models were very well done. Even for NPC's that were just walking around in the world. This is without a doubt a next-generation game, similar to the way 'Red Dead Redemption II' was when it released back in 2018. <br/><br/>Secondly, the score of 'Cyberpunk 2077' is absolutely awesome. Marcin Przybylowicz, P.T. Adamczyk and Paul Leonard-Morgan do a remarkable job at creating this vibrant and powerful soundtrack that enhances the experience of the game in every moment. A highlight for me was the track titled 'The Rebel Path' which is a song full of heavy synth layers side-chained by ultra-strong percussive hits and kicks. As a fan of electronic music, I had a great time listening to the IDM/EDM styled soundtrack of the game, even in its more ambient moments. <br/><br/>Thirdly, the gameplay of 'Cyberpunk 2077' had a lot of strong points to it. The weapons felt powerful and very fun to use in the many combat scenarios the game offers to the player. I also found the few boss battles in the game to be very enjoyable, and at times, somewhat challenging. Vehicle handling, from my experience, was well done. I loved the motorcycles you could drive and found that they handled very well. <br/><br/>Finally, the narrative of the game was fairly well done in my opinion. The main story had a few compelling characters, which through side quests and other activities, grew on me and allowed me to be invested in their contribution to the game's story. The voice acting was very well executed, especially in the supporting characters in the game. V's voice acting I found was compelling and versatile. Johnny Silverhand, voiced by Keanu Reeves, on the other hand, was less compelling, despite having a couple of moments where Keanu's voice acting was well done. <br/><br/>Now, unfortunately, there were some not so good things about the game. The most obvious of these is the game's large quantity of glitches and bugs. Bugs I experienced included subtitles freezing, music being stuck on repeat, not being able to un-zoom my character's focus, and a couple of others as well. Never have I played a game with so many obvious glitches and issues, which is crazy seeing I've played numerous Ubisoft titles and not even they were as buggy as 'Cyberpunk 2077'. It does ultimately make the game feel rushed and unpolished which is a huge shame considering how amazing its world and environment is. <br/><br/>Another area of the game that felt a bit lacking was its crafting and progression system. The UI for crafting was confusing and something I never used. Similarly, the progression tree in the game offered nothing that offered anything new or drastic to the game's core gameplay. Looting weaponry and gear was the only method I used to grow my character as in stores these items were way too expensive; often for no real reason. <br/><br/>Ultimately, despite its clear faults, I found 'Cyberpunk 2077' to be a solid game that I can find myself returning to play in the future. I do feel that the game could have offered so much more, especially in its main narrative which for felt honestly too short clocking in at just over 17 hours. Having played 'Red Dead Redemption II' (which is my favourite game of all-time) and having similar expectations that 'Cyberpunk 2077' could be at the same level, I do believe it falls short. Similar to games like 'Just Cause 3' or 'Assassin's Creed IV', 'Cyberpunk 2077' is enjoyable and well-made but it does come as close to the masterpiece I believed it would be. It has all the elements it needed to be that game, I can see it just by playing it, however, it never leaps to those heights. It always feels like it is lagging behind its best elements. That to me is something I felt throughout the entire experience of playing the game, the feeling that ""wow this is good, but I kinda wish this was better than good."" Nonetheless, I had a good time with 'Cyberpunk 2077'."
Cyberpunk 2077,"I have played over 100 hours and am STILL discovering unfinished or swept away chunks of game. Probably thought I was going to say ""I'm STILL finding cool stuff to do"" but... eh. I know I said I finished this but I'm glitched out of a few missions... If this were complete and reliable, it'd still be a 7/10, though, let's not get it twisted. Deus Ex in an open world with real consequences this ain't, check out the youtubes and see for yourself that it's not any more deep than just a good FPS with loot and sex scenes. It's an RPG like Borderlands was is what I'm saying - not a terrible game by any means, just nowhere near as good as anyone expected. Mission Giver 1 tells you to go to Place 1 and shoot Guy 1. Repeat 100 times. Maybe they had to cut the really fun parts out because there doesn't seem to be anything of value in the non-mission critical areas of the map. Is there even a point to the swimming outside of one mission (which itself was one of many several escort and listen scenes)? Is there a point to having any contacts in your phone when you can't do anything with anyone? GTA IV was released in 2008 to put things into perspective. Remember that video about all the dope cars you can drive? You grind to save money to buy them from people you never meet but somehow know your phone number and call you to say ""hey, V, got a sweet ride that'll cost you all the money you've earned so far stashed by a dock! Bye!"" So why did I play it for so long?<br/><br/>Well, the game is 7/10 so there's no reason to snub it, nothing special, but Keanu and the soundtrack really do make up for a lot of its problems. Hacking and shooting is better than Watch_Dogs and Syndicate so if you liked that combo kill style, this game has it. Maybe some of it was denial, though - I mean, all those reviewers couldn't have been lying to us! YongYea and Alanah Pierce looked so happy when they talked about it months before it dropped, right? That's why it's more fun to watch it being played than to flatline every 50 minutes on your own, honestly. Get it in a year when they fix most of it.<br/><br/>update: kinda fixed. All the next fixes have been pushed a year. It's cheap now and this is the most final version we're getting so go for it."
Cyberpunk 2077,If they fixed every problem with this game it would still just be pretty good. Not really anything going for it other than compelling characters and an interesting story. Everything else you have already experienced 7 years ago if you've played a deus ex.
Cyberpunk 2077,"Is it the gaming revolution we where promised? No.<br/><br/>Is it a good game? Yes. But also No.<br/><br/>The cyberpunk universe has lots of potential for interesting translations into gaming, but this title feels half cooked. The main story is drowned in a sea of openworld sidequests, icons and secondary fluff.<br/><br/>It is visually the most stunning example of what current graphics can do on PC, but it is also mixed with the most broken aritficial intelligence of enemies and npc.<br/><br/>The cinematics are good but still behind even those of the original Mass Effect.

The most memorable moments dont come from the main story but from sidequests.<br/><br/>The core loop of the game is going from one main quest to the other, while doing some sidequest to grind the cash needed for the very expensive gear and all that while driving for the most part.<br/><br/>The issues start here: the driving is below average, even worse then GTAV and that's an achievement on his own.<br/>The combat with a controller, even with snap-targeting is clunky, requiring a smart targeting pistol to become partially enjoyable or switching to close combat fights with shotguns and melee, the latter being overpowered.<br/><br/>The economy is unbalanced overall with excessive prices even for mid-tier level items, which causes the player to ignore shops and loot everything, triggering the next issue: unsatisfactory loot. The felling is of a homeless person picking up junk instead of well earned loot after a fight and all that mixed with a user interface that half the time refuses to pick upo an item if slightly outside the small interaction area.<br/><br/>Character progress is often boring with perks giving ""10% more damage on torso shots"". Player starts out with a small apartment, gets a few smaller and limited apartments later, but no garage to store cars or personalize them. Gear wise you have the choices between having high level stats gear or looking like a colorblind anti-fashion snob. No transmog option available.<br/><br/>The most annoying aspects are the user interface, especially the crafting section, which requires a complete overhaul. The rest of the UI is bad in terms of usability with popup windows full of small unreadable text. No option for changing the HUD color from the default distracting red. Health bar placed in the top left corner forces the palyer to constantly switch sights from the center of the screen, where the attention is required, to the borders and back, which will increase the sense of frustration."
Cyberpunk 2077,"Optimization is shit (with mediocre graphics). This game is unfinished. A lot of bugs and they are critical.<br/>My saves are broken and main story script doesn't work. Don't buy, just wait until the game is fixed (developers promised in February). The game doesn't keep promises that developers given. CDPR's reputation at the bottom now.<br/>In short: disappointment of the year"
Cyberpunk 2077,"I had my expectations set low and this still let me down. I'll be shelving this for a few weeks while I wait for CDPR to (hopefully) fix their broken game.

<br/><br/>Negatives:

<br/>-No support for standard virtual surround sound. I had to uninstall my audio driver and install Dolby Atmos to fix it.
<br/>-Awful performance, poor optimization, texture quality option is hidden once in game, extremely poor looking for how difficult it is to run. Reaching 60fps is impossible on my hardware (GTX 970)
<br/>-Information overload, awful visual clarity
<br/>-Poor UI design, clearly designed for consoles, character creator is particularly bad with strange mouse sensitivity issues
<br/>-Unremarkable city, GTA but with neon lights
<br/>-Key bindings can be changed, but not all of them. Notably, you can't change the ""Use"" key from F to anything else. It's stuck there.
-Extreme lack of polish.
<br/>-Highlighting and selecting objects in the environment fails when they are close together.
<br/>-Poor gunplay, bullet sponges and no impact
<br/>-Poor stealth mechanics
<br/>-Poor driving mechanics

<br/><br/>Positives:
<br/>-There's some degree of effort put into the characters and voice acting so far.
<br/>-In depth augment system"
Cyberpunk 2077,"I played the game. It's kinda good, but it have A LOT of technical problems. So i wait for PLAYABLE patch and replay it from beginning."
Cyberpunk 2077,Great game but it is hard to be as good as all the hype made it out to be.  I finished the game in less than 24 hours of game play and was sad to come to the end so fast.  Lots of things they could work on but this game in the future still has nothing but potential.  Still recommended but feel as though the company needs to act fast to keep people interested.  Online soon???
Cyberpunk 2077,"<div>This is a review in progress based off of the base PS4 Cyberpunk and low end PC performance.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>I'm not sure how to score this one yet. This is a current review in progress. I've played it on both base PS4 and a meh PC, aka gets sometimes decent performance on low graphical settings and let me tell you, it's night and day. The one seemingly most popular current example is the firs time you meet Dex and he's smoking a cigar. The smoke physics are night and day. Aside from that, the game looks miles better, even when it dips below the 30 fps range, the neon looks better, and their is no npc pop in like on base ps4.</div><div><br/></div><div>Quest wise, I'm very early on but the meeting with Royce, both build up and aftermath felt very good.

Cyberpunk 2077,"Concise Review:<br/><br/>While not the game I was expecting or hoping for, CP2077 is still a fantastic game with loads of quality content. Is it possible for a game to be a disappointment and still one of the greatest games of its genre? Yes it is. It’s CP2077.<br/><br/>Amazing: Character progression pacing is amazing for about 30 hours and then solid for another 15-25 hours, excellent longevity. The open world mechanics and quest design creates constant enjoyment with very few slow periods.<br/><br/>Great: Stories, writing, characters, voice acting. Overall amount of customization and character upgrades. Cyber ware and the unique gun categories add depth to the gameplay. Combat is great after the first ~4 hours. Very flexible play styles between, hacking, stealth, dialogue, and going in hot, including many different ways to fuck shit up.<br/><br/>Good: While a disappointment because of very high expectations, the city and world is still an entertaining sandbox play in.<br/><br/>Fine: <br/><br/>Bad: During the very best scenes the graphics are fine but for a lot of the normal content they are awful and honestly embarrassing. Overall presentation is poor when compared to numerous other AAA titles. <br/><br/>Awful: The number of duplicate NPCs is laughable. Bugs are not game breaking on the XSX but frequent enough to damage the immersion and on a few occasions caused more than minor frustration. It should be noted, CDPR’s release strategy was slimy and awful. Hiding the last gen console performance should be criticized. Classic corpo bullshit.<br/><br/><br/>Journal Style Review:<br/><br/>The opening hour is a bit slow, which isn’t a surprise. Every big RPG starts slow because they have a lot they need to introduce you to. The witcher didn’t really pick up for like 8-10 hours. RDR2 took a long time to get going as well. I’m not worried about the start, but it hasn’t done anything to wow me early on. <br/><br/>The graphics are disappointing. Most of the main characters and set piece scenery looks fine but other characters and objects look pretty bad, and then some look straight up awful. I wish the series X version released at the same time. I wish this game had more polish. The polish, at least in its current state, is not reaching my expectations.<br/><br/>5 hours in. The writing and the voice acting is top notch. I like Jackie a lot. Dex is a great character too and I’m liking the V I have created. I don’t like the generic NPCs. I kind of expected more. I was probably expecting too much in regards to how lifelike I expected the city to be. It still feels like a video game. <br/><br/>Jackie nooo!! I’m really liking the story so far. It is really good sci fi action. I haven’t done any real side quests yet but if they are as good as this main storyline I’m going to love this game.<br/><br/>The map intimidates me. So many icons and waypoints. I need to figure out what they all mean and which are live events I need to do right away. <br/><br/>I’m figuring out how bounties work which has been fun. I’m switching up my play style and picking close waypoints on the map rather than picking from the quest list to see which way is a better experience.<br/><br/>I love the attitude and banter between V and Johnny.<br/><br/>I’m getting the hang of combat a lot more and it’s been a lot more fun. The guns that can charge up and shoot through objects are OP. Especially with the cyber ware eye mod that makes you see enemy outlines when they see you. I like the sniper a lot too. Also I’m slowly learning about hacking more and it’s benefits. I rarely play as a hacker in these types of games but this one seems to do a great job of it so I’m incorporating it more in my game plan. This game has a lot of cool systems built in. I’m really enjoying it, I just wish the visuals looked better. It’s a shame that so much of the excellence in this game goes unnoticed because of the distractions.<br/><br/>There are so many ways to customize your character: Armor, guns, mods, cyber stuff, attributes, perks. There has been a very enjoyable constant sense of progression. It’s very well done. <br/><br/>The different clothing (armor) looks so goofy. My V looks like a fucking clown usually lol.<br/><br/>Picking quests and points of interest from the map is way better than choosing quests from the log. You get a better sense of the city and it’s fun to clear out small sections of the map. <br/><br/>The BD detective work parts aren’t good. I try to rush through them. Fortunately they aren’t too frequent.<br/><br/>Mr. Hands is hilarious. Occasionally this game tries a bit too hard, and the humour doesn’t land 100% of the time, but for the most part the writing is great and sometimes it gets it perfectly.<br/><br/>The combat in this game is awesome at times. There are some great huge shootouts and the guns feel creative. The different ways you can use tech and smart weapons is great. The ways you can incorporate hacks and stealth is great. The gameplay has surpassed my expectations. The combat is better than I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Oh man I just spent a bunch of credits on some sweet cyber ware  like mantis blades and a charged super jump. Very cool stuff. Bought some passives perk mods also.<br/><br/>I’m at about 20 hours in. From hour 8 ish till now I’ve mostly been doing side quests and map things, and I’ve been loving it. I’ve loved just discovering all the different nuisances to this game. It’s been a blast.<br/><br/>There are some scenes where this game looks pretty good. When the lighting is right and you can’t see too zoomed in it’s sometimes got a very cool look to it. And it’s pretty fun listening to the radio driving around the city from waypoint to waypoint when you want something chiller. This game is an unbelievable way point clearing game. It keeps growing on me. I’m getting used to the world and graphics so it isn’t bothering me as much as it did at first.<br/><br/>This game has pretty good stealth combat as well, even though the AI isn’t great. Hacking is a fun stealth factor.<br/><br/>The guns are so cool in this game. Combat feels great because I love so many of the weapons. I can’t believe I’ve seen people mock the combat. Anybody saying the combat is awful hasn’t played past the opening sections. Or they suck, idk, but I’m having a blast and often end up shooting my way in or out of a situation because I simply want to.<br/><br/>Another small perk of this game: it’s very easy to sit down and play for 15 minutes or 4 hours. It’s flexible in how long you want to play.<br/><br/>I just maxed out street credit which happened at around 27 hours in. Sure I’ve been playing a lot but I still am surprised it didn’t take longer. Right now I’m predicting that I keep playing this game until either my character is essentially fully upgraded and I no longer feel there are any meaningful improvements left, or all the quests become too easy. I hope that’s take a long time.<br/><br/>I hope there are more cybermods and guns still. I love what I’ve seen so far but I hope I haven’t seen it all.<br/><br/>These missing cab missions are fun. There is something funny about a suicidal AI cab calling me a cunt.<br/><br/>I’ve realized that some of the more in depth side quests usually are in the journal. I’ve been focusing on them more and some of them have been greats solving the murder with river was fun. A couple of those Johnny missions weren’t bad either.<br/><br/>~38 hours in and while I’m still finding new and interesting side quests with meaningful storytelling, I have also found the sense of character progression to have slowed. At this point I do not anticipate CP2077 reaching an A+. I predict it ends up as a middle tier A. Still a fantastic experience. Less than I hoped for.<br/><br/>Getting the most frustrating bug so far with Panam’s quest. “Well what’s up V.” Fuck! I had to reload like 5 different times for the prompts to work. Really wrecked the mood.<br/><br/>I’m losing steam and getting close to being ready to finish this game. I’m a bit over 40 hours and the last 5 hours or so I’ve really just wanted to beat the main story but I’ve forced myself to do all the meaningful side quests that come in my feed because I don’t know what the end game will be like, and once I beat the main story I may stop playing pretty soon. Still I’d say this game gave me 30 amazing hours in the middle and another 15 or so pretty solid hours at the beginning and the end. I’ve never been a 60+ hour single player campaign guy. Both witcher and red dead I think I ended around 45 hours which was perfect for those games.<br/><br/>I beat the main story. I was a bit confused with the ending at first. I had the ending where Johnny takes over Vs body and leaves town. It’s an alright ending that’s growing on me the more I think about it, but I still think I’m a bit underwhelmed. The final mission is a bit anticlimactic I’d say. This game has a problem because I wanted to finish so much side content that by the time I got back to the main story I had forgotten some of the details and lost some of the build up. Still, this game ends as a mid tier A. A disappointment, but still a top tier game. A generational favourite.<br/><br/>I plan to mess around a bit longer, buy the fancy cars, complete a few more gigs. Who knows how long that will last, but I do still feel like playing around on this world. That is another testament to this games fun factor. <br/><br/>Oooh man the Rayfield Cailburn car is sweet. I’m happy I played long enough to buy it. That thing is fun to drive. After really focusing on the major side quests and the main story at the end there, it’s been nice just flying through side gigs and driving around town between the closest locations.<br/><br/>Just unlocked the turbo R V-Tech and it’s even cooler than the caliburn. More my vibe. Very sweet.<br/><br/>This gun AI skippy is hilarious.<br/><br/>I’ve pretty much beaten the entire game. I’ve done every side quest and gig that’s in my journal or shows a waypoint on the map. I’m severely over powered for every combat. I think I need to call it quits. It’s been pretty great tho.<br/><br/>In conclusion. I liked CP2077 a lot.<br/><br/>Final Score: A"
Cyberpunk 2077,"<div>The game is effin' riddled with bugs to the brink of being, well, not unplayable, but definitely un-enjoyable.</div><div>Forced underwear due to a bug? Check.

Terraria,"""Terraria is like Minecraft in 2D ..."" Yes ne, it's clear!
The Sandboxing Game Terraria went unplayed in my Library for some Time. I had tried it once, but didn't get smart out of the Game principle at the beginning. Probably I was just too doof:D But after a few Videos on Youtube I started fully and teasing Terraria at the night. 
The Game does not directly have a Story, that is, different from Starbound, what is also often compared to Terraria, you have no History that tells why you are there. However, there is something like an Order in which you Fight the Bosses ' opponents. 
Before you can build off, however, you have to create a Character first. Clothing, Hairstyle and colour can be selected from a few Options. Then you create a World. Here you can choose the Size and the World is generated randomly. Now you can decide between Single-player and Multiplayer. What pleased me is that they are ingame servers. That means you don't have to rent a Server with IP, like Minecraft, or play on a public Server where you are constantly worried about your Belongings. No, you host yourself and can even encrypt the Server with a Password, so that only selected People can joine. Thumbs up from me! :D 
In the Game World, there are no Limits to Creativity. From the small Tree house, to the Castle to Pixel Arts, you can build everything and always find the perfect Building Materials for your Home in the felt 1000 different blocks. The Pixel Graphics, based on the 90s, do not disturb at all. 
To get to the Blocks, the Player has to go budding. So on to the Mine and zump for hours. But even that never gets boring. Especially when you play with Friends and you chat to them via TS or Steam'S VoiceChat, Time flies by As if you're in Flight. So it can happen that you still hang on the computer at 5 o 'clock in the Morning, even though only 1 o 'clock was! 
Absolute ""Addictive Potential.""
When Digging, you encounter one or the other Opponent or, depending on where you dig, sometimes a Boss Opponent. After a certain Opponent, the ""Normal Mode"" in which one starts becomes the ""Hardmode."" New Biomes are emerging and heavier Enemies are spawning. The further you get in the Game, the stronger The Bosses opponents and the Events that are partly summoned or happen by chance. But with the right Equipment and Friends to be At your side, such a thing is not a Challenge either. 
Crafting takes place at the specific Workshops. For example, you can make Wood on a Sawmill such as Beds or in Combination with Books bookshelves. The Craft Recipes for this can of course all be found online in The Terraria Wiki (believe me, you will always have the Tab with the Wiki open later in The Steam Overlay:D). However, you can always consult the Guide on Recipe questions.
Ah, yes! The NPC's! Almost forgotten ... In addition to the Guide, who is there from the Beginning, there are 21 other NPC's that can move in with you. Of these, 6 have to be found, 7 come after a certain Boss Fight or Event and the Rest will move in as soon as you have a certain Item in your Inventory and enough Space in your House. Each NPC is assigned a Room. Once an NPC has moved into you, you can buy special Items from it and thus improve and expand its Equipment.
Verdict: Terraria is awesome. The only thing to complain about, in my Opinion, is that the Music will eventually become too monotonous. But then you can still mute everything ingame and run Music in the Background. In addition, German Synchronization is sometimes really mispackered. 
Grammar goodbye!
 Not infrequently then, the Chat says ""Player was killed by"" to get around that, I just play in English. Since these are two Points that you can either easily fix or ignore, I think Terraria has earned 10/10. 
Feedback on the Review is welcome. ^^ And with that, Gamercookie over and out:D
EDIT: The new 1.3 update is great! When I pressed Grade Strg to have a Wall built automatically, I was shown the near Door in yellow. Now you can't get bodied and click on the Right thing! Works with Doors, Signs, Gravestones, buff items (Enchantment Table, Magician ball and so on) and Boxes. 
I am excited! :D
 There's an Asterisk On top of it!"
Terraria,"This is not a Minecraft in 2d! I'm already through (lunar Event and Moonlord are still missing :() and now, like everyone else, I am waiting for the 1.3th I hope that soon the 1.3 comes and I can make the final boss. The playing time is much longer and the possibilities are greater than in Minecraft There are 50+ armor and weapons, the many different NPCs bring the game to life and there are many different dialogues, the system of life is good and the controls are simple, there are multiplayer games, and now the 1.3 Version is coming, then it goes on
as a golem. I like terraria very much and would even give stars :)"
Terraria,"I have been playing Terraria since I was 9, initially I played it on the phone and then switched to PS3 and finally the PC platform. I must say that this impeccable game, always fun and has a lot of blocks just for the sandbox part! He never bored me, and always was my favorite game. Alas the mobile version has been neglected for 2 years unfortunately ... still remaining to the version 1.2.4.1 but finally I note with pleasure that the developers are engaging themselves again and I am sure that the version 1.3 will arrive in very little time!
P.S.
An addition that I would like so much cross play! I hope that with the reset of the mobile version (rewriting the game in order to make the porting of the next updates easier) they will be able to bring the game to the same level as the other platforms and maybe to be able to bring the updates simultaneously Console, and PC."
Terraria,"Actually a very good game, but the whole community has been waiting for more than a year for the new update that should bring the game to the 3.0. Also, the pics in the description are not a pity for Hardmode, also the jump to the end bosses Planterra, Fishron etc. is almost impossible without a friend you can connect with, despite turtle rigging and terrablade, even for an experienced player. Likewise the Grinding for Grnalgener (it takes about 18 hours of meatwall time to generate enough of the turtle power needed). For players who try on the krbismond or the frost moon the vampire knife is the most powerful weapon in the game as it does a lot of damage and you do not have to worry about your life, it will do a lot more harm than the terrablade or the equestrian's blade and other weapons ,"
Terraria,"Doing everything yourself is both a blessing and a curse.<br/>Tons and tons of options and exploration, but builing arenas for bossfights is annoying"
Terraria,"  Terraria provavelmente é um dos seus jogos favoritos(eu incluso), caso tenha jogado. Ele é um excelente survival, e cumpre perfeitamente tudo em relação ao combate. Possuindo muito mais conteúdo e mecânicas que Minecraft, creio que Terraria consegue superá-lo facilmente.<br/>  Em termos de survival, ele não vem com essa idiotice de muitos jogos, de colocar fome, sede e etc(não que seja ruim, mas existe trabalhos muito porcos, como em The Forest, por exemplo). Sobreviver não é tão fácil. A primeira noite você precisa se equipar rápido, principalmente no master. Falando em dificuldade, as escolhas em criar um personagem e criar um mundo são básicas, porém bem feitas. Têm tecnicamente três dificuldades para o seu mundo: normal, perito e master; cada um com sua diferença. E no quesito do jogador, você pode escolher que itens você droppará após sua morte, sendo que a última, custa a própria vida.<br/>  Já em termos de combate, é impressionante. O jogo possui uma variedade de armas, armaduras e até mesmo de classes. Além disso, a também equipamentos que irão te dar buffs permanentes se caso eles estejam equipados. Para finalizar, a modificadores nas armas, tanto pra pior quanto pra melhor, enquanto os equipamentos podem dar uns buffs específicos a mais(defesa, dano, velocidade, chance crítico...).<br/>  A linearidade do jogo pode ser meio confuso caso não tenha visto um guia, mas acho que assim é em qualquer survival, praticamente.<br/>  O jogo também algumas coisas secundárias que podem te dar ótimas recompensas, como pescar os peixes das missões, ou então fazer um tower defense.<br/>  Na 1.4, o jogo adicionou um sistema para os npcs, podendo estar felizes, ou tristes. Com isso, a economia do jogo ficou muito mais rica, com você podendo escolher a quem irá deixar mais feliz, pagando assim mais barato.<br/>  Um excelentíssimo jogo, com diversas mecânica e muito conteúdo, você poderá passar horas jogando. Se quiser mais horas extras, ainda tem o tModLoader, que se encontra aqui na Steam, sendo aí que você poderá jogar com os mods feitos pela comunidade."
Terraria,"Esse jogo é um minecraft mais estiloso, muito legal. 2D, muitas opções de armas, itens, lugares para explorar, equipamentos e coisas legais para fazer. Você joga e nem percebe o tempo passar. Recomendo para quem gosta de explorar."

Dota 2,"First of all!
It is important to note that the Game is free and therefore reviews relate to whether the Game is not rubbish Despite its non-existent Price. Also, it is not a Pay 2 Win game, only skins are available for purchase, which does not affect the Game. Thus, in my Opinion, most negative Reviews are unjustified.
What is Dota?
Dota is a Game of Catogeria ""MOBA."" Basically, everyone should be aware of this Type of Game. Now the Only question is whether you want to try the Game. Did Answer: Definitely. why? To do this, you should read these und/or other Reviews.
My Beginning Initially I hadn't thought of Any MOBAs. When, after some Time, a Friend with almost a lot of opinion decided to take a closer Look at the Game, he was pleasantly surprised. Then I Decided to test the Game at some point. After Months, the time had finally come and I, too, was positively surprised. After only a short Time we were even able to get another Friend, who surprisingly Found his Fun at the Game sooner or later. Since time immemorial, we have been playing regularly without having Lost the Game.
The Game itself and the Beginning Should be new to business like me, it is almost Obligatory first and Foremost to look at Tutorials and The Like, because the Mechanics are not comparable to most Other Genres. After a fairly short Time you should also play against other Players. Even if you don't know all or not very little, the rest of the knowledge comes on its own, whether it's simply because you always find out new ones and sometimes even Players are nice enough to give some of a Tip. If you're Lucky, you might have a Friend who already knows the Game and leads you into the Game.
The Comparison to other MOBA Even if Dota is the only MOBA I play, I have heard many things about other MOBA. For example, Dota is supposed to be heavier than others, which I don't find. At least I don't find it hard in general. Also, many Heroes in their Look.Skill should resemble each other strongly. But overall, they probably differ only on (very) a few Levels.
The Graph I have no References to other MOBA here either, but I have to say that the Game looks good and not bad In any Case, just Right by the many Customization Options. 
Among the System Requirements: Even if you have a bad PC, the Game should run halfway smoothly.
My Reasons for the Game: It's free No Pay 2 Win Low System Requirements Giant Community (Millions of Players) Around 10% negative Reviews speak for themselves Many Tutorials that greatly make it easier to Get you started In the Game Permanent Updates, which is also the More often new free Content offers Very many Customization options in the Form of skins for everything around 100 different heroes, all of which are completely different and provide a varied Gaming Experience. Don't just want To watch tutorials before playing The genre interacts a not Me it often happens that I play against too strong Opponents, who sometimes decide all by yourself the Outcome of the Game Also with me often Low-race Series (5-10 Games) occurred that should not occur in a skill-based Matchmaking of this Magnitude Not all Players are of the English Language authorized Games can go up to 90 min conclusion: The Game is free and also no Pay 2 Win, so should consider a one-man Ask the Question if you want to try the Game. And I can only say yes to that.
:) Best game!"
Dota 2,Over 8k hours. One advice - never start playing Dota 2. It will change you beyond all recognition. I know it. I got max rank in this game
Dota 2,"Dota 2 is a love-hate relationship translated into a game, with the highs being transcendent and the lows being painful enough to make you regret starting the game in the first place.  All in all, the gameplay elements unrelated to team interaction are so well done that I recommend that gamers try Dota 2 at least once, but the Dota 2 community and the unbalanced nature of gameplay are flawed enough that it falls short of being exceptional.<br/><br/>The Good:  The game play is unbelievably rich, with 119 heroes, 155 items, and a huge number of different mechanics and strategies.  This is the type of game that you can play for 250 hours just to get enough competency to be able to play the game without other players flaming you, and there are so many different possibilities that each game plays out differently enough that it's not boring.  Indeed, the variety of strategies is so great that you can basically adapt Dota 2 around any player's weaknesses and preferred style of gameplay.<br/><br/>The Bad:  Players in Dota 2 are generally easily frustrated and will tend to flame or even deliberately play badly if you make mistakes and frustrate them.  I am very polite to players so I have the highest possible behavior score, but I still have a surprising number of games ruined by toxicity, uncooperative teammates, or poor communication.  Anecdotally things are much worse at lower behavior scores, where you might have teammates that don't speak English, who deliberately try to lose, or who will basically play in a certain way to try to force other players to accommodate them.  The other problem with this game is that wins and losses tend to snowball, meaning that losses turn into humiliations that further feed toxicity and tend to tilt players.<br/><br/>I tend to avoid Dota 2 these days, since I find that it tends to feed procrastination and addictive behavior, but it's clearly well-done so I would recommend it to other gamers.  Just be aware of toxic players and try not to get too angry after a crushing loss."
Dota 2,"The best game I can hardly recommend.<br/><br/>Dota 2 truly is a marvelous achievement.<br/>The game in itself is amazing. The gameplay is fantastic, the game is balanced and when a game goes right and teamplay happens, it's a joy.<br/>The issue is - teamplay rarely happens. The community, like in most multiplayer games, is where issues start appearing. The constant toxicity can turn your game from a pleasant experience into a special kind of hell.<br/><br/>If you want to get into it, I would recommend starting with a bunch of friends.<br/>They have made tremendous progress to help ease new players into the game and the Free-To-Play model is undoubtedly the best in the market (everything is free).<br/><br/>Playing with friends - Exceptional.<br/>Playing alone - It varies between 'Good time' to 'I want to kill myself'.<br/>It really pains my heart to see such an amazing game plagued by its terrible community."
Dota 2,"<div>The game is a living legend, so it’s really hard ti review. Dota 2 is also a thriving pro cybersport with the biggest prizes, that means the game will be up for a long time with new patches and updates coming regularly. I’ve had so much fun playing it that I barely noticed 2000 hours passed. </div><div><br/>Though popular the game is, but I must tell that it is not an easy pastime. You will be beaten, humiliated, hated, abused, tortured, broken and finally dead lots of times. And yet it’s hard to stop playing, coz you get superhigh when you win a 60 minute fight. The extraordinary number of players also leads to the phenomenon: no matter how well you play, there are always thousands guys who play better than you do. Keep this in mind if you only start playing now, there’s just no point in trying to become the best, that is just not possible.</div><div><br/></div><div>

It also has probably the highest concentration of douchebags, fumbfucks, dickheads and Dunning-Kruger patients in the entire gaming community. So the social part of playing often looks like this: one sane guy constantly tells his party of a few crazy guys to fight enemies, not each others.</div><div><br/>If you are not afraid of all of the above, then give it a try, and you’ll get probably the best free MMO of all times with more than a hundred heroes and items, infinite replayability.

Dota 2,"Cancerous community. Not very accessible to people new to MOBA's, low skill cap."
Warframe,"Nabend ladies and ring for The first Time ES IS ES WERT! I played from the Game vllt just under 15% and played 4-8 hours most of the time I spent it flying, floating, swimming, gliding, drifting under water however you call it and looking around The sound the soundset HAMMER. The control I have to say a cream cake it feels so clean and gentle that you no longer want to give the controller out of hand. I would like more this type of KUNST you can switch off and let it really be tiled In hat.
Short Facts, It makes you feel IT relaxed it makes SPASS and it fits everything I love it does everything right and I certainly have 80% still in front of me what is coming and what I am where on a earth? Or water planets other planets? I have No idea but I like it is mysterious and so mysterious today it was a good day in the sun night."
Warframe,"One of the best, gossip, the best Free2Play Game ever. 
Support is great before you get tired of the Game, zack has suddenly been added free ne whole new Open World (Now the second!).
The Finalization model is great and is looking for its same, you have the Possibility to get faster with Items or Cosmetics (#fashionframe) by Purchasing so-called platinum (premium currency), but the Leveling of the Weapons always takes the same time, as well as the Championship Rank (Accountrang). In addition, this does not give you any Advantages, since everyone is limited to their Rank and most weapon/warframes, grade in the Initial Range, are all great and you play together anyway. Trading allows you to Get Platinum Quickly if something is needed. Everything is earnable without Premium Currency (with the Exception of Cosmetics = &gt; Trading).
Now to the Community, I've never seen such a friendly Community, grade at the Beginning I was able to ask such stupid Questions and always got nice Answers from numerous others.
Therefore 10/10. Tip: Just give it a try, after all, it costs nothing if you get stuck: Even Guilt;)"
Warframe,"Have made me fall in Love with Warframe!
Why? Because, in my Opinion, it's one of the best F2P Games on Steam. 
Graphic: Just incredibly beautiful Space atmosphere that makes you marvel again and again.
Even on Medium Settings, the Game still looks good. 
Control: Some claim the Control would be ""Complex"" which is totally not true. 
You always have a Tutorial To Choose from, which shows you how to do something, and after the Tutorial and a few Battles you should get along with the Controls well clear.
Story: It's about ""space ninjas"" that maintain the Balance of the different Faction. There are 3 different Factions, Corpus, Infected and Greneer. I don'T want to spoil you too much. 
Items &amp; Shop: There are credits in the Game where you buy Blueprints but there are also ""platinum"" which you can buy with Real Money OR you can get to sell THINGS you have dropped FOR Platinum. This is of course very cool, because if you have good Items you can sell them and directly pick up a new armor/weapon without waiting about 24 Hours until your Weapon was made in the Forge. 
Verdict: As I said, for me it's one of the best F2P Games ever. Since I've played Warfame, I've had little Interest in Counter-Strike. But that's also because the Waframe has an incredible cool Community that's always helpful. I can recommend this Game to any Of the fast Gameplay &amp; Space. 
10/10."
Warframe,"I don't know why I like this game. It's a mind-numbing grind through and through, and the free to play model definitely puts a damper on things. But even with all that, I still enjoy my time with Warframe. Is it the builds, breadth of content, or the satisfaction of chipping away at the game? I don't know. But I find myself enjoying Warframe whenever I jump back in. And if you're new, brace yourself for the brick wall that you're gonna face and be sure to have a second monitor with the wiki open. The new player experience has improved, but I wouldn't say that it's good."
Warframe,"Thousands of hours of content and not a single moment they ask for your money, countless hours of fun  braking the game and feeling that euphoric hit after hour long survival runs really never runs dry, burnout can be a huge issue tho but analysing the game on its own it's without a doubt a masterpiece."
Warframe,"warframe isnt a bad game by nature, it s just his design who make it bad. Having a looter shooter free2plai is feasable destiny does it but in the case of digital extreme the challenge is so much higher cause of the nice fonction of the game: the mod. In this looter shooter u can attach one mod to every weapon u want, mod had modifier on certain stats who will make u abble to progress the enormous content awaiting for u. This hunt for mod is fun the first 50 hour but while continuing playing u see something u cant believe. And it s true this game have no end game u are way too powerfull for nearly all the content, it s just supid grind and dev know it cause after 7 year of existence they add booster like double xp .... on the store. Lot of people love the game and u can understand cause the game have good time but u will quickly see that except good time it s just stupid lazzy farming. Just to point i have 700 hour on the game"
Warframe,"Warframe's gameplay is smooth as hell, but that's not enough to make up for its shortcomings in pretty much every other area. Forced wait times to ""build"" items, unlocks and quests requiring you to grind out repretitive missions, its murky UI, and its progression system all could have been hand-waved away if it weren't for the final wall to your progression: a pitifully low inventory limit that requires you to use the game's premium currency (purchasable only with real money) to increase it."
Warframe,"Get your friends and go fighting! This game is meant to be played in co-op, and it’s really awesome. It plays smoothly and gets better every month with huge updates. Another advantage - it’s free to play, so you can always give it up if don’t like something. But you’ll be satisfied, I promise. "
Warframe,"The developers try to convince everyone they play this game but I’m sure that’s a lie. If they played it, they knew the game’s main mechanics was grind and that was strange. The worst thing is that the grind is without any goal - you can’t finish it. You need to grind every mission, grind to get mods, grind and grind again.
I could forgive this if the rest of the game is exciting but AI here is dull, the enemies are retarded and the weapons are far from being called awesome. Very far.

Warframe,"its free to play, so like give it a shot, a lot of people like it, but it didn't grip me at all."

Metro 2033,"The World after a Nuclear War – since ""Wasteland"" and ""Fallout"" At the latest a popular Scenario for Computer Games, which we have been served again and again in recent Years in different Packaging and Presentation. Sometimes more, sometimes less successful. ""Metro 2033"" falls into the former Realm, according to the unanimous Opinion of Trade magazines and Critics. And I'm inclined to agree, although I'm somewhat reluctant to blow just as enthusiastically into the praise anthem horn.
In ""Metro 2033,"" we embody the young Russian Artjom, the City of Moscow, devastated by Nuclear War, that his Existence in the dark tunnels and Corridors of the old subway. A daily Struggle for Survival – against Hunger, against radioactive Radiation and against aggressive Mutants that threaten to overrun the Metro stations, the last Retreats of the People. To prevent this, we should now get Help from the large Enclave of polis. A dangerous Path that we take in the classic First-person shooter perspective and which, at the End of the Day, Plays out a little differently from Call of Duty, Crysis and Co., because ammunition is not only extremely rare, it serves even – if it comes from Pre-war Stocks – Also as a Means of Payment. So You literally hide Money, which means that we rarely do the Deduction for an extended Period of time. Each Ball should sit better, also because the Enemies usually compete in large Numbers. A nice Idea to increase the Degree of Difficulty and at the same time to underline the predicament of humanity – however, really only purposefully at higher levels of Difficulty, since you get right in normal Mode without having to buy anything somewhere. Good Accuracy.
""Metro 2033"" suggests a big Game by means of its Map, but it doesn't represent a truly open World, but opens up in usual Level Hoses. In this Case, inevitably, we are finally moving in a subway network. And that really feels like one at every Second, too. In Particular, the atmospheric Lighting underlines the Goosebump Factor of the many Corners, Caves and Canals, which we enter rather hesitantly with flickering Lighting and sweaty left Mouse button. A blind Pre-storm is usually gouged with a quick Death. And also prevents us from recording the many Details that have been lovingly staged, especially in the Stations. A certain Tristesse-which is naturally wanted and conditional – still comes up. Quite soon one Develops a Sense of the imminent Danger – which does not mean that we do not let the Estuary Fire illuminate here and there in a panic anyway. The Goal: Just in the Dark at the Crossroads of human Civilization – It is met by ""Metro 2033"" really satisfactorily.
Anyone who has been waiting for a But all Along now, here it comes: Despite the Horror, despite the empathised Loneliness – somehow ""Metro 2033"" has left me Astonishingly cold. I hardly noticed The Difference between ""Communists"" and ""Fascists,"" desperately sought a Sympathy Carrier (This is especially true of the ""Homo novus,"" whose Fate is at The heart of the Plot). Nothing against Dirty bags, but since everyone doesn't really care about everything here, that starts to color off at some point. Somewhere in Whole, the Motivation has been lost to me. Why do I have to Go to Polis now? What am I launching a Rocket for now? The Answer to these Questions kind of goes down with me. Which is remarkable in that there are enough Passages in which you would have Time to Ponder. 
Technically, ""Metro 2033"" is not to be blamed. The Graphic at that time was already ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ The Sound Effects (especially the Mutants) provide a continuous Goosebump Guarantee. The Level Design is very detailed. And the Handling of Weapons is also good, although Rapid-fire Rifles become superfluous From the Middle of the Game onwards. Without a Shotgun or Magnum, you quickly bless the Temporal here.
Would I have To put ""Metro 2033"" in one Word, it would probably be ""depressing."" If the Developers would have achieved one of their Goals, after all, there has been a Nuclear War. However, I do not need a second Round in the Moscow subway floor. And this despite the Fact that there would have been a lot to discover in terms of Achievements.

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,"After over 350 Hours I can say it makes fun. It makes fun to build the FOBs, to collect for the Development of the technologies and Weapons. Also, the Technique in the Game is solid. Better Textures, Shadows, Shaders and higher Visibility Than on the PS4 and Xbox One consoles. On my System with 1080p and high To very high details with almost constant 60 FPS (occasionally light drops). After all, my System from 2013 and just above the PS4 is in Performance. Good Performance and graphics (though not a Graphic Reference). What bothers me is that you don't get simpler mods for it. 
(Spoiler Attention)::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: I am also bothered that I cannot use the self-developed mini Metal Gear in the Game itself. Even a few other Things on the Maps bother me. Would have been Class if there are Side Missions where you have to rescue civilians from the Military or even a Mission where you only have to gather information (as a Side mission). So far, most Side Missions are too similar. 
Graph 8/10 (stable Performance, barely until no Bugs and 1080p/very high Details at 60 FPS does not require High-end Hardware from 2013. From Nvidia GTX 660 and HD 7870 it runs round) Story 9/10 (solid but not short Of Cutscenes and too little from the typical Metal Gear Solid flair. That's because of Openworld Setting) Gameplay 9/10 (plays well, but I miss few Things that existed in Predecessors like Eating the Emergency of Animals, caring for wounds, Bird ♥ ♥ ♥ e where you can slip at the Race. Just such Details from the Predecessors and also the Level keys to break into Bases I lack. There should have been more Doors on the Enemy's Bases and these would be Unlocked by Level Keycards. I particularly liked that about my Predecessors).
Sound 8/10 (Well nix really special have heard better of other Games, but also worse.)
Music 9/10 (It's boring from time to time, but in the Cutscenes it's logically better and also the Main Missions make it better.)
Scope: 10/10 (So many Weapon types, such large Maps, enough Missions and Things to find, collect, Build up. Whoever builds up their Bases in under 100 Hours and develops everything and does every Mission is good.) Every Side Mission, every Animal captured, every Main Mission was accomplished and every Waffe/technology developed ... Never underestimate what there is in scope.
Total 9/10 Points Verdict: Good or even very good Game, which is obviously not finished because of the Dispute with Konami. There are things missing That existed in Ground Zeroes (like turning off the Alarm in Bases) and other Things also point to the Hideo Kojima Having to stop too soon. Even so, the Game has gone well and even though real MGS Fans will be a bit disappointed it's good. You must not hang on it that it is not a pure and typical Metal Gear Solid. If the Game is Objective and without Fan Boyglasses, then you can recognize its strengths."
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,This plays like an absolute dream. I would love this if it didn't take a shit on a beautiful series
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,Instead of playing stealth i just ripped ass on everyone and they all shit themselves 10/10 very sexy game
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,"The gameplay is fantastic. The replayability of missions is something that I found enjoyable throughout while barely scratching the surface of the mechanics offered. The story I can't even elaborate on and so I took the Dark Souls route and decided to play as if it was completely optional. When I paid attention, it was sometimes rewarded albeit with other times feeling quite lacklustre or at worst, embarrassing and thus the SKIP button was employed. But when you're replaying a mission for the 5th time trying to get an S rank and all extra tasks, with music or a good podcast playing, that's when I find MGS V at its best. <br/><br/>ALSO, this game looks and runs amazing. TRuly spectacular"
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,"<div>*Spoiler free*<br/></div><div>Boy oh boy, where to start.</div><div>First off, the game is literally a scam. It deliberately decieves the player. Now, some of it is obviously completely intentional (take a certain menu at the very beginning with the doctor, you know what I mean), some of it the game tries to hide desperately, like numerous times where this ""open-world, NON-LINEAR"" game actively forces you to do certain things exactly the way the devs want.</div><div>Make no mistake, this is NOT an open world game - it only creates the illusion of the open world. The exploration value aside from gathering a few scattered resources here and there is literally non-existent. You just go from camp to camp and that's literally all the free-roaming freedom the game grants you.</div><div>The menus are cramped with infoboxes, buttons and numerical values to the point where it's literally ""oh **** it's Eve Online all over again"". The management part of the game thus is just pure hellish torture unless you're a big fan of your screen being full of numbers and letterboxes.</div><div>The controls are somewhat counterintuitive - I've struggled for a few hours getting used to the traversal system, and I'm no noob. Get ready for quite a few awkward moments where you dive head-first onto the ground in a prone position when trying to jump. Did I mention there is no jumping in this game? Oh yes, you will NOT be able to climb anywhere where the devs don't want you to be, even if it makes perfect tactical sense.</div><div>Now, the fans of MGS franchise will probably expect it, but to all the newcomers out there - beware, this game is effing WEIRD, and not always in a good way. You'll find that the game utterly disrespects you as a player on numerous occasions. It can't even decide what it is - is it a stealth game with serious themes and issues and maybe a few fun easter eggs here and there, or is it a straight comedy ****-show riddled with things calling for some cheap laughs, especially when it's extremely counterintuitive and to the narrative and just feels off. Remember Mass Effect where there were some good laughs when the situation was appropriate? Forget about it - this ""masterpiece"" just loves to sell itself as a cheap 90's sitcom.</div><div>Know why they called it ""The Phantom Pain""? Because you'll be constantly getting phantom pains from the things that you expected to find in this game but they're not there.<br/></div><div>All in all, I'd recommend to avoid this game if you're not a die-hard fan of the series.<br/></div>"
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,"Wow. Just wow<br/><br/>MGSV is probably the best metal gear game ever. Let’s be honest here for a second. I have never seen a game that gives you as much freedom as metal gear solid game ever. Now I know your thinking of that dumb ranking system where the game wants you to finish it as a non lethal stealth walkthrough, but to hell with it. When I’m allowed to destroy the air radar with c4 bombs then bring in my own chopper to make a full on assault while I’m making my escape is an option, imma do it! Now I know metal gear kind of drifted off from their initial storyline, but the story honestly isn’t as bad as people say it is. And also with the buddy system that they implemented, now that’s something else. The buddy system is essentially a system where you could bring your comrade to the fight and help you plan your playstyle. You can either have quiet which is a female sniper with super natural abilities, or D Dog your friendly dog and start to command him to kill people.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think this game is a must play for everyone not just metal gear fans. There are just a ton of ways that you can infiltrate enemy bases, which means missions don’t lack any repetitiveness. And honestly, the story is worth paying attention to ngl."
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,I think this was an exceptional game. Everything is so well thought out. <br/><br/>The only complaint I have is that the ending was weak 
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,"This game alone I can play all year long and won't get bored. Played each mission multiple times, tried plenty of variations, tortured the game in every way possible, but it refused to show any weakness.<br/>Outstanding gameplay, marvelous story, killer graphics, realistic effects and characters, balanced resources, exceptional attention to details, stunning music collection and heart touching ending. I can go on and on and still won't do any justice to how great this game is. Hats off, Hideo Kojima."
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,"I’ve never played a Metal Gear game before this. So I didn’t know what was going on with the story to begin. I didn’t really know what was going on with the story after beating it either. And you know what? I didn’t fucking care because the gameplay was so so good. There were so many creative ways to accomplish your mission. There were so many guns and gadgets that you could unlock that allowed you to play so many different ways (some of which were ridiculous). The enemies would adapt in creative ways so you also had to adapt. The game looked and felt great. There was always a sense of, “what if I tried this”?<br/><br/>Final Score: A+"
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,"A masterpiece. After 60+ hours I finally understood why this game is called ""The Phantom Pain"" Kojima in the end made us feel the same phantom pain which felt characters of this game. You feel the missing content. Its like it is still there, and by leaving konami and his franchise he made sure the pain will be forever with us."
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,"It just had the beautiful start, the hospital scene, that OST made it just so good. I can’t believe the amount of content squeezed into this beautiful created masterpiece."
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,Hacelos concha Snake!
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,the titties of the female character... same so realistic
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,As stellar as the gameplay is I can't recommend 2/3rds of a game to someone

Rise of the Tomb Raider,"-Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20th Years Anniversary Edition-Even though Lara Croft'S Breasts haven't grown since, so did her Ego.
We are in The footsteps of her father (Classic Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider Cliché) at Lara's first, own and volunteer Expediton. In Search of the Source of Immortality, she chases the Secrets of a Prophet behind and runs a Race against time, since, to cover all Tomb Raider clichés, a mysterious Organization called Trinity itself Hunts this art fact into the Hands of this Art fact. Want to get.
Yes, why do I mention Tomb Raider Clichés so often? Well, RotTR can be played as an experimental but extremely successful Crossover of the Tomb Raider 2013 reboot and many previous ones, especially the Legends series, Tomb Raider Games!
I had ENDLICH Back There feeling Tomb Raiding To operate without constant defensive shooter deposits:D
Maybe I'm slightly negative towards this Game, but NO, this Game is ' the absolute Hammer! I had more Fun with this Game than intermittently another Tomb Raider Part.
Already mentioned Above, RotTR uses a classic Lara Croft Story this Time and sends us into the Depths of the Siberian Wilderness. While the Main Mission gameplay technically is more based on the 2013 level, there are optional Tombs to explore, which can be explored in the classic grave robber style and whose Puzzles can be solved. It's Worth it, as you can get loads of new Gear to make it easier to Play. Although the Puzzles and Gameplay are relatively simple. Say, Main Game: Run, climb, shoot and solve a few Puzzles if necessary. 
The Level of difficulty is adjustable, the Game was right in the middle (!) on ""Experienced Robber"" but still quite light.
BUT there is once again a Lot to Collect in RotTR's Open-World, Such as super detailed Relics to View, documents with interesting Content that complements the Main Story, Murals for Translation, Challenges and even Missions of various Kinds.
In need of Getting used to it, the Keyboard control could be at the beginning, which was slightly modified to The 2013 part (similar to the modification of the Control of Tomb Raider Legend (2006) to Underworld (2008)), which nevertheless proves acceptable.
To the Graphic there is ÜBERHAUPT nix to complain about because the is ' delicious! At the cutting Edge of the world ... And Lara's Hair &lt; 3 However, one Criticism is my Side: The unconstant Frame rate. According to the Developer, at least with the Geforce 970 should be able To play at a high Level of Detail, which was not really the Case with mine. In order to obtain a reasonably constant FPS number, I had to partially scale down the Graph by a considerable amount than the Settings suggested to me. Still, Performance still weakens in larger Areas and especially in the Cutscenes. By the way, which were extremely elaborate and mega beautifully implemented. The Cutscenes against!
So much for the Main Game, now to the DLC's:-Blood Gang-HOLY SHIAT!! I was animally pleased when I learned that you were implementing a Croft Manor again! Blood Ties are mainly about saving the Crofts estate, which is redesigned but oriented on the 2nd Manor (Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary and Underworld), Before Lara's Uncle's Plans. So we now have to collect Relics and Documents spread across the Manor and use them from their information for puzzle Solution. Personally, I think this Game principle Is extremely good, and I would like to see such combination tasks in the main Game in the Future. Meanwhile, we take the Property apart, we also learn a lot about Lara's Past and the Life of the Crofts. And every now and then there is a Lot of Nostalgia in this DLC ... &gt; &gt; more may still come with the Baba Yaga DLC, etc:D"
Rise of the Tomb Raider,"A great game that's bogged down by the trappings of modern open world games, cheesy storylines and microtransactions. A product of it's time?"
Rise of the Tomb Raider,"Maybe I just didn't get it, but Rise of the Tomb Raider felt very unpolished and like it wasn't prepared for people to play it. During the main story, you actually only go in two or three tombs. There are extra tombs to explore, but I didn't feel like I had to in order to get better or get cool items. The main story tombs maybe make up two hours of playtime with most of the time in this half-baked open world with enemies that are more closely related to potatoes than human players. Despite its efforts to create a half-stealth experience, nothing felt more effective than just running in with an AK-47 to mow down some horribly trained soldiers. Maybe I should've cranked the difficulty, but my run of Rise of the Tomb Raider wasn't great at all and left me with an awful taste in my mouth. Graphics good though."
Rise of the Tomb Raider,"My first Tomb Raider game after so long. Impressive gameplay, graphics and effects. The game balance skills and perks really well. Though the story is quite limited in this time and age. Anyways, I'll recommend to adventure lovers."
Rise of the Tomb Raider,"This was the first Tomb Raider game I've played, and I enjoyed it! Really great gameplay moments, using different kinds of arrows, and the stealth made the experience really good. I didn't much care about replaying certain areas, collecting lore or doing the Expeditions, but I still enjoyed it! I very much plan to continue playing Tomb Raider, since it has now become one of my favorite game franchises!"
Rise of the Tomb Raider,"See my review for shadow. This game is pretty much the same but I liked some of the unique sections more in shadow. I think this series looks very good but is just average. Also, I did like no tombs when I was playing, maybe I just missed them but I didn’t think the game did a good job of directing you how to explore.<br/><br/>Final Score: B+"

Batman: Arkham Knight,"Batman™: Arkham Knight (Bought for about €30am in The Keyhshop) What is purely clear from the front is that you need a very good PC to be able to play this Game sensibly!
Yes, the Implementation on the PC is unfortunately the biggest shit and it does not look like the nice Colleagues can save this Game, too bad actually ...
Personally, I can't complain, because with MSI's 980Ti and INTEL's 6700k, the Game runs with me as oiled on a constant 60FPS and also looks stunning! On Story and so on I don't want to go down great that everyone has to play for themselves but you can definitely say you will have enough to do! Arkham Night still somehow managed to become my Favorite Batman Game, because the Combat System, the Graphics, the Story and everything around it is very much successful! :)
GUTER PC = BUY! :)
NOT SO GOOD PC = LOIIIIVER NOT! :/"
Batman: Arkham Knight,"One Of my Favorite Games! 
I'm a big Batman Fan and in this Series he's been very well implemented. Also his Relationship with other DC Characters like Tim Drake as Robin, Jim Gordon and others.
To the Game itself, all I can say is that it can be played great. The Combat System has a lot of depth with Batman's technique like the Batclaw, Sturgeons, smoke Bombs etc and, in my Opinion, is significantly more Fun than Fights in Games like Assassins Creed or The Witcher. 
The Openworld Aspect has also succeeded well. There's plenty to uncover and it's Fun to fly over Gotham's Rooftops as Batman. The optional Sidequests reward you with additional Boss battles, which I think is extremely cool! 
But not only the Characters and the Gameplay have succeeded well, the Action, Cutscenes and Story Elements are also the spirit Of the Election! Without spoiling: A Moment in the Story is so emotional and strong that it is one of my absolute Favorite moments in the Game which has a super idea with an incredibly good Implementation. 
And as a Batman Fan I have to say, the last 30 Minutes of the Game until the first End are just epic.
I write first End because the Game still has a second End. And that's pretty much the only thing I really have to criticize about the Game: A Sidequest involves collecting over 200 Trophies hidden somewhere in Gotham. Only when you collect them do you get to see the Boss battle of this Sidequest. You have to complete all Sidecests to get a Cut-scene after the End with the absolute End. But Since I don't have a buck to do anything boring like collecting over 200 Trophies (which, however, are always behind a Puzzle) I had to watch the Cutscene on Youtube. That hasn't taken the Fun off me now, because it doesn't make a difference for me whether I see or ingame a 3 minute cutscene on Youtube. It is nevertheless frustrated that you do not allow you to complete a Game because you still have to collect 154 Trophies.
Still, The Game has my absolute Recommendation. One Of the best Openworld Concepts. One Of the best Combat Systems in Openworld games. Absolutely exciting Story. And Batman is as much Batman as it gets!"
Batman: Arkham Knight,"Best combat, best hub and best traversal. Shame about so many sections just being tank battles though"
Batman: Arkham Knight,"Batman: Arkham Knight is my favorite entry in the Arkham series. Which feels strange to say. I believe this entry has some of the highest highs, but, also some of the lowest lows *cough cough Batmobile cough cough. First, let's talk about the highs. The classic combat system comes back in its most refined form, providing the most fluid experience yet. You can get by with simple maneuvers but for those who wish to delve deeper, there is a lot to experiment with. You can intertwine your combos with take-downs and an array of gadgets.<br/><br/>There is another facet of gameplay that is new to the arkham series, the Batmobile. When you're zooming down the streets of Gotham, swerving around cramped streets, mowing down thugs, and engaging in vehicle pursuits the Batmobile is an absolute blast. Unfortunately, the Batmobile can enter into a tank mode. At first, it seems pretty fun, just another way to vary up the gameplay. However, it gets boring after a handful of times, annoying after ten or so, and mind-numbing when you're well into double digits. It's a real shame that such a good experience has this one major flaw. To be clear, tank combat isn't bad, there's just too many encounters and it is so much more shallow when compared to playing as Batman on foot. I am willing to forgive the tank combat because the rest of the package is so good.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the story, but, my standards to enjoy a story are pretty low so take my opinion on it with a grain of salt. I thought it was pretty good but not as good as Arkham City. There is a twist that I as someone who is not a Batman fan could see coming from a mile away. When it happened I couldn't tell if I was supposed feel surprised or not, it just fell flat on its face. I honestly don't think that it detracts much from the story but I am aware that it's something that people aren't happy with. I don't have much to say on the story front as I'm bad with dissecting and analyzing them.<br/><br/>Arkham Knight is filled to the brim with side content. The side missions (except maybe for the Riddler) are pretty good and worth doing just to experience their side narratives. Some are weaker than others but for the most part they are pretty decent. There is bunch of other stuff that is a complete waste of time. I am largely sick of Ubisoft style checklist open-world activities, so if you aren't tired of that style then you'll love what's here. You have riveting activities such disable mines (aka Batmobile time), take out enemies in one of many generic outposts, collecting too many riddler trophies, etc. I got some enjoyment from doing some of those activities but I have no desire to do them all. I want a game not a 9 to 5.<br/><br/>Overall, Batman Arkham Knight is an excellent game with some notable blemishes. There was enough good to outweigh the bad for me but others may have a lower tolerance."
Batman: Arkham Knight,"Apparently I got lucky and Arkham Knight ran without any problems on my PC. Anyway, the technical flaws have been dealt with, so the reviews should stop focusing on them.<br/><br/>Best game in the Arkham series. Combat is perfect and funny (just as was in previous games), Batmobile is tremendous fun (although a bit overused) and everything else is great. Plot and cinematography feels like from a professional movie, voice acting is absolutely superb (Noble as Scarecrow is perfect). The ending is incredible - full of emotions, logical yet still mysterious, focusing on Batman's darkest fears. If you played previous Arkham games, then Arkham Knight is a must have."
Batman: Arkham Knight,A next gen game that came out in 2015. This game is brilliant an deserves to be noticed as a GOAT of gaming.
Batman: Arkham Knight,"It would be a perfect Batman's game if there was no freaking Batmobile. Am I playing World of Tanks or what?<br/><br/>P.S. Here is some Joker for you, guys<div class=""editor__insertion""><div><img src=""https://media.rawg.io/media/user_images/69a/69a0dbee4060e64704a1d4a9cc672b80.gif""/></div></div>"
Batman: Arkham Knight,"Combat at it's best, Stealth at it's best, writing at it's worst. Just batmobile, just batmobile, just batmobile..."
Batman: Arkham Knight,"The greatest superhero game of all time. The game looks fantastic. The art design and atmosphere is very well done and the graphics are equally impressive. The combat feels fluid and makes you feel like Batman. The gadgets and the increased mobility that Batman has in this game are great additions from the previous games. I really enjoyed the batmobile challenges. I also enjoyed the bat tank missions but they are the only type of challenge in this game that I found a bit repetitive. I’ve seen lots of criticism on the bat tank and I think peoples criticism gets way out of hand. <br/><br/>Lastly, I absolutely loved what they did with the joker in this one. This game has a great Batman story.<br/><br/>Final Score: A+"
Batman: Arkham Knight,"I was incredibly hyped for this game, especially as all the others I have really enjoyed. The mechanics of the game that they didn't change are still great i.e. the combat, puzzles, stealth and grappling around Gotham. However, the inclusion (for some daft reason) of the Batmobile really brought down the fun. Too much of the game was focused on Batmobile combat and puzzle solving and it just didn't work very well. On top of the story is predictable and doesn't do much to build upon the exceptional work that went before it. Such a shame... "
Batman: Arkham Knight,I think this a lot of people's least favorite arkham game.  It's my favorite though.

The Walking Dead: Season 1,"Definitely a unique game design, which, with its ""drawn"" style, creates the atmosphere of a comic book. For the most part, the game is an interactive movie and a quest at the same time. Very pleased with the directing. The framing is top-notch!"

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,"The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a good Role-playing game, with some good Aspects, such as the good story, the good Graphics for the Year of release and the good Soundtrack that fits well with the Scenes of the Game.
The Combat System is still relatively difficult when you play the first Game, because you have two different Swords and Attacks, the Iron Sword against human-like beings and the Silver Sword against Monsters. There is also a fast and strong Fighting Style. You get used to the Controls relatively quickly, even if it is still different at the Beginning than with other Role-playing games.
The German Synchro Is okay, but it could be a bit more emotional. I really like that there are moments when you can Decide for yourself what you want to do.
Bad about The Witcher 2 is that the Game likes to crash, no matter which PC, but you should just cache in between, with F5. Then you don't have to play that much new.
Plus, I'd think it would be nice if the Story was a little longer. 
From me, ""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" gets 8/10 Points (s).
Since it is the Enhanced Edition, the Steambibliothek uses tools to find ""The Wichter 2: Bonus Content, where you will include the Maps, an Artbook, the Soundtrack and some other Files."
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,"So, I want to add my Mustard After 23h Playing time and a Run. First Of all, I would like to think that I find 23h too short for an (action) Role-playing Game ... While not all Sidequest did it, it might have reached 30-35h ... Still too short!
Let me start with what doesn't suit me at Witcher 2:-Playing Time clearly too short!
-Third Act too short!
-partly free Decision-making options, but sometimes do not change anything-it annoyed me animally when the AI in front of me opened the Door, but I could not step through with it, because the Door was closed immediately-worst of all, it was that the Game-with German Text Language-gratuitous Crashes ... Without Error Message!
What I thought was good:-Graphic just great!
-very short Loading times-Detailed Game world-many different Opponents (Monsters, Magers etc.)-free Decision-making Options-&gt; Incentive to play the Game again (Bin currently at my 2nd Run)-boss opponents ""relatively heavy"" (if you don't have the right one Tactics has)-there are extra arena fights-Story is not linear and easy top!
-Geralt is a ""real"" hero: Can speak (sounds iwie doof ... But the Hero in Skyrim can't, for example!), he can flirt, threaten and Condemn (if you like)-many Weapons and Armor, which you can also have manufactured for Blacksmiths, for example (if you have the appropriate Scheme) But also Alchemy ingredients (you can find Almost everywhere)-d ie Dialogues that you can conduct are well written-very well staged characters, e.g. Triss, Roche or Iorweth Envy: That I couldn't get the ""The Witcher"" Series off at first, I have to say that it ""captivated me."" :D
""The Witcher 2"" is a great Game for little Money that you just have to have played! The Only Pity is that the third Act is kept very short (also from the Sidequests) and that the Game sometimes crashes without a reason (Put the Text language on ""EN"" and the Bow is fixed). Still, the Game has many more positive Sides than negative ones, which is why it's worth buying and playing ""The Witcher 2"" as it has a high Replay Value (for me)!
9.5/10 (the too short third Act and the above king bug)"
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,"Well I've heard that The Witcher 3 was a big hit so thought I'd give the prequel a try, enjoyed it really, the game was amusing, the world was astonishing and truly made me feel like a part of it, great rpg game"
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,"Let's keep it short and to the point. Witcher 2 is cool! ;)<br/><div class=""editor__insertion""><div><img src=""https://media.rawg.io/media/user_images/67d/67d80af81ba19bb330bb9e3f49ecfee8.jpg""/></div></div>Yea, I know, these are a very useful review"
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,"I love every Witcher game - that’s why it’s so sad to claim the balance in this particular title is broken. If you play it on easy, it’s TOO easy - you just hit your enemies and don’t even need to dodge much. But the normal difficulty makes you suffer. The combat system, while being repetitive, isn’t explained well and you need time to figure out how to defeat enemies. That is so annoying! As a result, a great game isn’t just enjoyable for me, as I want a normal intuitive combat system, not this mess.  "
The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition,"The Witcher 2 is much better than the first game in may aspects. They added a more complicated combat system, you now need to use potions, oils and bombs, and carefully choose what abilities to upgrade. The variety of choices also makes you complete only one half of the game at once, as in the second chapter the game splits in two. That’s why you really need to complete the game twice at least to try the choices you’ve missed. I think, it’s a great decision to build the story like this. And, of course, can’t say nothing bad about the visuals, characters and side quests. Everything is perfect here. BTW, what campaign did you choose for the first playthrough? I’m team Roche! "

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast,Half Life 2 Lost Coast is a playable Demo version whose source engine has been expanded to INCLUDE HDR (High Dynamic Range). This free Demo showcases the fantastic new Possibilities of the improved Engine.
Half-Life 2: Lost Coast,"SMALL DEMO SYMPATHETIC: half-life 2: LC is just a technical demo that introduced HDR lighting to the source engine and nothing more. Don't expect a real game! 
Try if you find it for free otherwise you can drop it!"
Half-Life 2: Lost Coast,"You can play through in 15 minutes and also not get any story but its supposed to be a graphic demo. worst bucks to game ratio. It should cost only 3$ regular to give people a taste of the game (besides the half life 2 demo).
I would also like a demo for this game, which would lead as far as the stairs."
Half-Life 2: Lost Coast,"I'm not going to do a very built assessment by the abuse on the game time. Overall the game respects perfectly HalfLife 2 and its codes with a graphic enhancement which in my opinion represents what a beautiful game! From the action, a funny little adventure but extremely short and no other chapters available.... to buy in bundle or in the Pack Orange I think it's his name."
Half-Life 2: Lost Coast,"A level course that serves as a showcase for valve's know-how. This is not a game.

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"THE BEST GTA OF ALL TIME!
And I'm not chewing my words! Even though the graphics remain old school, this game is so awesome and addictive, lots of missions to do, a lot of things to do to get fun, even mutli with buddies etc... 
In short this GTA is cool. 
The ragy will say that GTA V is better, I will answer them no, because in SAMP we can not get out the CB to buy money in the game.
GTA SAN ANDREAS must be one of the only ones to group many people in multi (+ a million)... The proof is... GTA IV is no longer playable on WIN10 and no one is on the mutli.
If I had only one negative point: the mouse bug. I explain: I do not know if it has already done to you but a few times GTA does not detect the mouse and so I have to play without. (So I play the keyboard)."
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"So basicly i have unninstalled the game not deleted unninstalled and when i try to download it only says OPEN and i dont know what to do or if its a problem if you know what i should do please message me on Discord -vStronger#8700 or snapchat lukasz_dj or just call me my number is +4746342924.
Great game LOVE IT!"
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"Thank you thank you thank you for making me rediscover the real times of GTA the real game this!
You have been phenomena to take it in digital format
But I have a problem on iPhone 8 Plus the game crashes very often even if I don't have any apps in the background solve this problem
Thanks again the wonderful game"
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"GTA simply ...
Excellent portage of a cult game, we do not regret the purchase! The price is more than reasonable for a game of high quality and very intuitive (touch control)
Very fluid on iPhone 6S and graphically very honorable.
For an even more unforgettable experience: buy the GTA the trilogy pack of bets to get for only 13, three cult games of which one will be finally offered to you (economy of 6) So do not hesitate! :)"
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"Very nice game but prone to crash after prolonged sessions, which is quite annoying, especially when you have to complete the last mission (among other things, happened to me during the last interlude ...), I also believe that the checkpoint saving system was not well done , because often when you fail a mission you have to repeat useless trips. However, this port can bring the experience of one of the best GTAs on your iPhone without compromise (I think the controls are quite functional), but sometimes, unfortunately, you have to be patient with the faults I have listed ..."
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"The game is the usual one, shame about the visual and game bugs that undermine the overall experience of the title.
Among the most serious I can say that some elements like the airport gates and the cranes of San Fierro are completely invisible but that exist in the environment since we are going to collide against if we do not pay attention.
Another bug specifically for the completists happens when you go to Michelle for an appointment and the girl asks to drive instead of CJ, too bad that once she goes to the driver's seat CJ stays out of the car, unable to even move the character because a script is running the view remains isometric causing the appointment to fail."
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"Still peak GTA. CJ is based, the missions are beyond fun and there are so many systems to engage with"
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"Yeah so I beat the game about EIGHT times and also ONCE without cheats from start to finish every mission, if that doesn't make me a true gamer I don't know what does."
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,6/10
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,"I do not recommend this game. There is no Linux/BSD port.

Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,"So after I got my Bug problems fixed (Check Datein) I am Writing my Review again.
I don't think I have to say too much about this slightly older Title, but I still want to do my impressions. 
The Game is a great Title whose Story Plays between the Books of ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings.""
The Story is kept quite simple, so I'm not going to say Anything about it to avoid Spoilers. 
The Game World Mordor is very lovingly designed, and with the HD Textures DLC, The Game can still be seen today, Mordor is not very large, and Consists of only two Areas that you can quickly walk/Sneak through. I haven't even used the fast journey in all The time. Since I preferred it has to fight my way through.
The Combat System is kept quite simple, and it is relatively difficult to die As long as you can counter, and deal with Shield opponents. Likewise, it will then be a little too easy, because you no longer have to fight the Opponents big, but simply to kill them en masse instead of them. And then let them kill, and when they have done their Service, you just Destroy them. So even the most braving greyly becomes an absolute Laughing Stock.
Furthermore, I like the whole Uruk Chiefs And the opportunities you are offered to deal with them and the lower Ranks.
However, they get a little too easy in the first Part of the Game because you ascend very quickly here as in other Games and have a walk from the Midgame. Example Games: Kingdoms of Amalur or Lords of the Fallen.
Now I have finished Hunting Kampanie, and for this Short but very well done Story you get a little more from the Dwarf Torvin and get to know his View of the Things. 
And here I have to say that this Kampanie has made me sweat a little more because the Focus here is on the Creatures. Especially the Last Chief and Fighting Champion really demanded me this Boss had more fire than any other Boss so far.
And from this Kampanie I am really hard hyped, now I just lack the Kampanie with Celebrimbor and then I would be so far through. 
And the big Schreenshot Editor, discovered Late by me, is absolutely Awesome, you already know it from Mad Max, but here it's a bit more Extensive. And so you can Perfect the Screenshots that are Perfect for you. 
Nevertheless, I have a Shortcoming, and it is about the Memory System. Either you Store at the Towers, or through Story-based Quests. The Game probably doesn't save any other way. So Whoever Collects everything, and does the small Side Tasks, and finishes the Game without taking advantage of any of the above opportunities, is allowed to do it all again next Start ... big Minus point for that.  
Verdict: First Of all, sry for so much Review. But you should have just played this Game, it strengthened and weakened. But if you can Hide these times for this slightly older Title, then you definitely have your bright joy at the Uruk Gemezel. 
You don't need to know the Books to understand the Story either, the Story tells everything quite well at its Core, even if There are gaps. So Reading books is not a Duty, but is recommended. 
And if you can't do anything with Middle-earth, you won't find fun here.     
Clear Buy recommendation, you could actually miss a very good Game here."
Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,"Hey, Warner Brothers, you got a bunch of properties, right? and a pretty successful track record making games, right? So, let's talk about other games where you could implement the nemesis system."
Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,Solid experience. Very fun building up armies of mind controlled orcs. Combat was fun although I remember this game being a bit too easy. I didn’t care about the story. The second builds upon this game and improves it in many ways but this one was still a solid experience.<br/><br/>Final Score: A-
Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,"After 20 hours I am so tired of Assassin's Creed: Shadow of Arkham that I am uninstalling it. I have no intention to return to the game and regret the time I spent with it. <br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Gameplay-wise, Shadow of Mordor is an exhibition of achievements of game development of the past few years. Roughly speaking, it's 49% Assassin's Creed, 49% Batman Arkham series and 2% of its own.<br/><br/>The Assassin's Creed part is effortless parkour, climbing towers and “synchronizing” for fast-travel and stealth with a few ways to distract and eliminate foes. Although I must admit that stealth here is more inventive than in AC, it's not just whistle, wait, one-button kill, rinse and repeat. At least later in the game you'll be given more tools to assassinate: such as poisoning the beverage and controlling uruks.<br/><br/>If you fail at stealth, here comes the Batman Arkham part. The combat is a shameless copy-paste and works like this: counter every time you see a prompt, attack every time no one is attacking you, perform a special attack every 5 blows, rinse and repeat. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I must give credit that the combat is actually fun and made me stay with the game for so long. It feels good to chain combos, the killing animations are satisfying and varied and there are quite a few special moves that you are going to like to perform. But when it's the only thing that makes you stay, it starts feeling repetitive after a while too. I can ruin this for you before you play, just watch the 404 hits combo below and you'll know just about everything the combat has to offer.<br/><div class=""editor__insertion""><div class=""editor__iframe-wrapper""><iframe allowfullscreen class=""editor__iframe"" sandbox=""allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-presentation"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9OrDtGblfLg?start=0""></iframe></div></div>Story<br/>The 2% come in the Nemesis system, the gimmick that journalists went on and on about and that actually made me play the game. It generates random uruks for each playthrough, bestows unique strengths on them and cripples them with unique weaknesses. These uruks have been fighting for power and will always be, and you act as a disrupting force which shakes up their hierarchy as you please. The problem was that I didn't want to. <br/><br/>I read dozens of nemesis stories on the web before playing Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, and all claimed what a unique experience it was to gain a mortal enemy that kept coming back from the dead to face you once again or to bind with an uruk and stay in this love-hate relationship for hours. Perhaps I was too good at the game, was I? I never had an uruk to live long enough for me to get to know him. They all were just expendables, and I cut through the cannon fodder of Mordor with ease. To be honest, I died more from the deadly fauna of Mordor than uruks. At the same time, bumping up the difficulty seemed strange as I understood that more hit-points would not be likely to breathe in more personality into random-generated uruks.<br/><div class=""editor__insertion""><div><img src=""https://media.rawg.io/media/user_images/2e2/2e21e415d821daa1c9afe3b201271809.jpg""/></div></div>What's left from Shadow of Mordor if you remove the “make your own story” gimmick? Not much, I must say. The characters were uninspired, the storyline was hard to follow and slow to progress, and the twists were simply not there. The story is pieces of Tolkien fan service scattered around the dull bloody cursed land. The first major character you meet is, of course, Gollum with the exact voice, moves, and looks of that from the film. I completed more than half of the storyline and Shadow of Mordor was a parody of Tolkien which distorted every stylistic or narrative trope of the source material. It's not necessarily a bad thing and I, in fact, have never been a fan of the Lord of the Rings universe, but it was a weird mix of fan service and negation of Tolkien at the same time.<br/><div class=""editor__insertion""><div><img src=""https://media.rawg.io/media/user_images/15a/15ae5ecd43ef6f8c2eaf1744c02b211c.jpg""/></div></div>Atmosphere<br/>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a very stressful game. It has no ups, the music is always tormented strings and dark ambient effects. It makes you paranoid, you scout for safe places when you start playing but soon you realize that the only places where you can rest are forge towers (fast-travel points) and the pause screen.<br/><br/>Does it make you FEEL like you are in Mordor? Yes, and this is a good thing. Does it make a game enjoyable? No. <br/><div class=""editor__insertion""><div><img src=""https://media.rawg.io/media/user_images/53d/53d71cda9c9a2ef2dedd24cfc02f03ea.jpg""/></div></div>This was, perhaps, the main reason I am dropping the game with no intention to play it. I don't mind repetitive and plagiarized gameplay, after all, there are only so many things you can do in action-adventure games targeted at a wide audience. I can tolerate the dull story and even no story at all in an action-adventure game. But I can't play something that is so hostile, unwelcoming and unrewarding. You can't conquer this world, you can only make a dent in the army of Sauron, which will soon be replenished by new random-generated uruks."
Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,"Playing this game in 2018, when it seems every game is open world, is not that exciting. It has all the necessary ingredients for this kind of game, collectibles, various mini-missions, towers to uncover new map parts, but we saw this already in countless other games. What differentiates this game from the crowd is its nemesis system. But the catch is that I didn't like it that much, it's an interesting idea, but not executed too well.  The most infuriating thing that it forces to use this system in order to progress the story, one time you have to kill 5 different war chiefs and other time you have to brand them. This is when you can see various design fails of the nemesis system and I almost deleted the game due to these parts. "
Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,"This game is a bunch of bad decisions. The Arkham Asylum type fighting system makes the gameplay look like a dynamic QTA thing without any choice. It’s ridiculous that the enemies always (like, ALWAYS) attack you one by one while the rest of them are watching your fight. The game is too easy and even if you lose a fight (you must literally drop the controller to lose here), you won’t die - you just get up and run, and, well, you’re safe.
Even the graphics are not that good now when we have so much better things on the market, so don’t waste your time here.  
"
Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,"Can’t stop playing this, even think about calling in sick. Shadow of Mordor definitely deserves the money. I haven’t got such fun for a while, you can’t imagine how good the story and combat are, so go try it better. Even if you get beaten up by a regular Uruk, you’ll be able to revenge soon and that’s an awesome feeling! "

The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,"I have read about the Witcher many times, and heard that it is a good RPG, etc. 
Basically, I played very few Role-playing Games of this Kind, because I haven't liked this Kind so far. I'm more of a Fan of JRPGs (the old ones from SNES;-)), turn-based RPGs or action RPGs like Titan Quest.
I only got This Part of the Witcher because it was mercilessly reduced, and I thought to myself, what was to take with me.
Then I thought to myself, I'll just start, and play it. And I have to say it was good from the Start and got me carried away. 
For me, the Game is a Mixture of action RPG and normal RPG (ala Elder Scrolls or the like). The Fights are in Real time, but can be stopped to think carefully about the next Steps. 
What is unique, and I've never seen like this, is the alchemy system. You can use a variety of Ingredients that you can find All over the World to make Potions, Bombs and Blade Coatings (the German Word doesn't occur to me).
This is interesting, and can lead to The Search and Collection of ingredients. So you can get yourself pretty strong Fight bonuses, which can ultimately make all the Difference in a heavy Fight. I didn't feel so much Like looking now, just taking what I found. This allowed me to produce one or the other Potion that helped me in the various Battles.
The Story was a bit too stretched and convoluted for my Liking, and I couldn't quite follow. All in All, though, she was okay. 
There are Role-playing-typically many different Quests that you can solve, a lot of which are optional.
Here I liked that you could activate the Quests on the Map, so one usually found the Way quite good.
So you gain Experience, and can level up your Witcher. Again, this is slightly different from other Games, you can't directly increase values like Strength, Skill, etc., but increases different Aspects that belong to one of those Values. This will make you faster, deal more Damage, be able to plug in more, etc. I thought that was good, was something else.
The Sound is Super and leaves nothing to be desired. The Graphics are, of course, not quite as fresh after 9 Years, but still look chic and fulfil the Purpose.
Funny were some Conversations with NPCs, sometimes there were some People in the Background with their Arms around or fidgeting around. 
What else is to be mentioned? Oh yes, the Game is definitely meant for Adults, because you can spend a nice Time in Togetherness with one or the other Lady, and if the Blood splashes in fountains while Slaughtering a Human being, that may not be for Children either.
All in All a good Game, you are busy with a few Hours, you want to see everything, and play the Game on hard, then you have to do safely at least 50h.
Achso, one Thing has struck me as a negative. The Storage Levels take away so much Space, because a single storage Level has a time at a time 30MB. And you have half 100 Pieces or more of them.
When I'd played for a few Hours, I wondered that Syncing into the Steam cloud took so long. Yes, that happens WHENEVER you have to upload 990MB to the Cloud. Luckily, Steam has limited the Storage Space to 1GB, otherwise the Game would have juiced up 3GB every time. :-D
Last but not least, I have to say that I am looking forward to zocking ""The Witcher 2,"" which should be better again by Corners.
Here is my Conclusion: Story: 7 Sound: 9 Graphics: 7 Presentation: 8 Atmosphere: 8 Total: 8"
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,"They were still working out the kinks, obviously... but everyone should play this spoiler-free for a master-class in story-telling in games."
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,"It's interesting to recall the first installment of The Witcher saga after playing the second and the last part with all the expansions. I remeber how excited I was when the game came out. To be honest, I was a long-time fan of the witcher and had read all the books twice by the time, watched the shitty Polish movie and was craving for a new story in the universe. <br/><br/>So if you are a fan of the source-material, then you will be delighted by the game, because it picks up where the books left. It throws a bunch of recognizable characters together. Sure it is kind of a fan-service but well when you ARE a fan, you just don't care about it.<br/><br/>The storyline, the choices, the charaters are extremely well-made. As for the levels/maps/areas, I think their design could be improved a bit, since there are some places where there's no content, it's just a place for grinding by killing monsters. But the overall quality is still very good. I loved the combat system a lot: there are three basic styles:  (1) to fight a group of enemies, (2) slow but strong, (3) fast but weak. You have to keep the rhythm of the fight in order to commit effective combos. It goes well with descriptions of fights you usually read in books, so to me it felt very natural and at the same time quite innovative as I had never seen something like this in an RPG before. The signs (i.e. spells) are also here but, to be honest, I am not into magic much and it wasn't until The Witcher 3 where I started to use the signs heavily and loved them.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a great RPG of that time. It perhaps can't be compared with the third installment but it laid a sound foundation for the following parts. If you enjoy RPGs, this is definitely a must play. If you are a lover of the witcher books or other dark fantasy stories, you'll love this one as the most solid fan-fiction in any form you can get."
The Witcher: Enhanced Edition Director's Cut,"An immersive world with a captivating storyline are here, however it can hardly be compared to the mighty sequel and the third part. First, there’s a dull combat that makes you keep the rhythm which is basically the only skill that will get you through the game. Side quests are very generic and unrewarding. The areas/maps/levels in the game vary in difficulty greatly which result in some grinding for experience. The game is definitely worth playing if you want to meet the characters and learn the pre-story of the witcher, so beat it and then play onwards to Witcher 2 and 3. "

BioShock 2,"I played the first Bioshock (as well as many others here) and was thrilled with the depth and the ingenious atmosphere of the game.
The second part I also found very nice and entertaining, but not as captivating as the first part. As mentioned in the title, I find it a good expansion for the first part, nothing more. For the fans of Bioshock but a must!
P.S .: If I played the first part, really two times, because one could act there ""good"" and ""evil"". So I did not feel like going through this version again in order to finally be able to watch another end video. Perhaps because the two versions are technically and slightly different from the game options, and thus invite you to simply run through the levels, just to reach the big end. Because everything else has already been seen somewhere (mostly in the first part)."
BioShock 2,"bioshock2 following the first big bioshock of the name happening 10 years after the events of the first se bioshock2 is a real scnaristics suite with a gameplay improve we find what made the strength of the 1st but with a lot of improvements the atmosphere still excellent bioshock2 can be a very good experience despite its short-lived faults, bugs of all kinds, no assertions in the scnrio, choice of weapons that resemble those of the first, but it will not spoil the pleasure of playing with the qualities it has .
For the multiplayer I installed GameRanger but I see that there is no one I do not know if it is a bug or no one go but in any case I do not see the server bioshock2 pity if someone wanted to know how it works should not put LAN parts unless you want to bet between you but they have to disable GameRanger strange."
BioShock 2,"I had already played through the title on the Xbox360 and at the special price I thought BioShock on the go on the MacBook would be nice. The game itself is great and only to be recommended, what exactly is going on can be read in reviews. A solid shooter with easy role-playing elements, a very dense atmosphere and great sound design.
Now to technical side. I was skeptical as to whether the game was going to slow down on my MBP 13 ""Early 2012 (Core i5, HD3000, 8GB RAM), and in fact I have to say that the device does not come off easily, I appreciate the frames / second times to 25-30, with occasional lags and slightly longer texture loading times, despite large-sized memory.As with all other games also turns the fan on full pot and the CPU heats up to 90 degrees (CPU and GPU sit yes, since the Core-i are pretty close to each other.) This is a bit of a hassle but if you are not put off by it or if you have a much stronger Mac you should not have any problems here."
BioShock 2,"A worthy successor to the original. While the story might not be for everyone (it is amazing!) the gameplay is undeniably more refined. Besides, any excuse to go back to Rapture one more time is more than worth it."
BioShock 2,7/10
BioShock 2,not as good as the original imo
BioShock 2,wow bioshock 2 really shocked my digestive tract 9/10
BioShock 2,"The worst of the three, and still quite good."
BioShock 2,8.5/10
BioShock 2,get the remastered version
Half-Life 2: Episode One,"Come on, let's go for great adventures with father Freeman, but this time, mainly in the Citadel and then in Cité 17, in a revolt against the cartel which obviously has trouble managing the situation.
Well, if you were expecting a lot of novelty in this half-life 2: episode one, this will not be the case, and this is not serious at all, since this is the avowed purpose of the episodic system. The title is, by throwing quick glance here and there, strongly identical to half-life 2, and you know what? Good. For this part, it is better to preserve bases that have proved their worth in 2004 rather than to actually seek to innovate.
So, as you may have read in the first paragraph, we start the title in the Citadel, badly damaged due to the events of half-life 2 and we will therefore have to stabilize it in order to prevent it farting in full City 17. And it is with our friend Alyx that we will take care of that. And that is what is very interesting: Alyx.
For most of the game, she accompanies Gordon, and it turns out she's a fantastic companion! What for? Simply because his artificial intelligence has been much worked and, as a result, she is very responsive, has a realistic behavior, shows her feelings even! Although sometimes he can make a few meatballs at the travel level, it's a pleasure to play with her. She is neither invasive nor glued to you (she knows how to distance herself). In the end, valve had a great idea to immerse the player effectively without looking too far.
Level atmosphere, nothing to say, it is always as prodigious, as in its predecessor. This feeling is accentuated in levels as in the Citadel reactor room, I particularly was caught up at that time. We can also talk about the first moments in Cité 17, with its buildings in pieces and the shots fired in the distance. The music is also always good and very high volley. Such for French voices, which sometimes lack a little conviction, but the dubbing are successful, no doubt about it.
Graphically, the title is always very pretty, despite its age. The source engine is comfortable apart from some barely remarkable failures. At the artistic level, it is always as impressive but a hair in DECA, compared to half-life 2. Nevertheless, a great success.
So here, this part is not lacking good ideas and will reserve you very good times. Now, where does he fish? Well in some very sensitive places and it hurts a little bit anyway.
Take for example the lifespan, unfortunately quite short. I understand that this is not a big part and that it does not have the objective of being, but still. The game still ends in 3-4 hours, more efforts would have been welcome to this side and not that a little, finally, anyway, let's move on.
Another problem of lesser severity: the lack of novelty. Yes, I know, I said at the beginning that it was not a concern in itself, but I would still not have been against some small surprises to renew the gameplay.
Rating: 16 out of 20"
Half-Life 2: Episode One,"A good DLC in which Gordon's journey continues not alone, but with Alyx. The game design here is sharpened just for two, in which the game hints at the fact that one can not cope here alone."
Half-Life 2: Episode One,"It's literally a continuation of Half-Life 2 and all that entails, for good and for bad. And it's incredibly digestible in the episodic format. But it does so little different and focuses way too much on the squad mechanics that don't work too great or do anything particularly interesting that it feels like a stopgap more than anything. Wow, Combine-Zombies? Companion system but then they put you in levels too small to maneuver around your companion? Another Strider fight? Throwing Combine around with the gravity gun exactly like the end of Half-Life 2? Ok. You could skip straight to Episode 2 and not miss much of anything."
Half-Life 2: Episode One,"Episode One is a very good follow up of an amazing game, it maintains its core gameplay and expands it to a more complex level, the only thing is that is that is very short (like two hours or so) but if you're like me and you're playing this on 2018 you have a little more HL2 waiting for you. My favorite part and maybe in the whole series is when you're stuck in the dark and the thing goes like full survival horror, just sublime. "
