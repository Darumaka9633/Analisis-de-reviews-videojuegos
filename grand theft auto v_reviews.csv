"Gta Online: What was a REALISTISCHES Game at first ... Where you accompany your Character on his Way as he completes missions and earns money to buy a nice Apartment has recently evolved into a Game about the ABSOLUTEN MEGALOMANIA. 
For example, at that Time the Adder (bugatti veyron) was the most popular Car in the Game and the most expensive and if you saw someone who drove him you knew that the one had ordaically ""Cash in the Täsch"" yet this changed unfortunately and cars became more expensive and Real estate ever crazier When you Join a Server these days, you'll find pretty much the following: You're standing in a place ... Where you might look at the mobile phone first and you want to transfer the Money you have, you hear it popping ... What happened? Another player drives you over without reason and shoots you without being able to get up. 
Since the update, it is also extremely common that one is killed by one of the new FLIEGENDEN Motorcycles or simply taken away by an Orbital satellite during a Mission. So around 500,000$ ... But this is for most Players no problem about 95% of Players have not earned their Money honestly.
They have been given the Money by Modders or have multiplied It using Explode methods it is really sad that such an unrealistic and unfortunately broken Game has become full of Modders and Idiots.
As for Rockstar's anticheat measures, these have failed across the Board, you see more People with a player level in The multi-digit dog range than ever before and Players who want to work out the Money honestly are doomed to be in Solo Sessions To grin missions to keep up with the others."
"Now I also have to give up my Mustard to GTA V.
SinglePlayer: The Game is typically GTA like simply horny and makes you feel Like it. Carts steal and mop up, trade on the Stock market (which gets a bit rogue with Time) and the Heists you can often pull through in several different Ways. Add to that the Special Abilities of each Character and the typical Open-World Feeling.
In short: Must Whim and is a clear Buy recommendation Multiplayer For those who don't have it yet: Honestly, I have no Idea what Rockstar thought, but I think it was purely about coal. As a Beginner, you have hardly any Opportunities to afford even a little, especially if you play alone and no umpteen Friends to pull you along. Will be boring in the Long run.
Worst Of all, though, are all the Kiddies that (almost all) had SxX with my Mum and howl unFlemish, and especially all the Cheaters. You are shot by a wandering PIXEL. Gaaaanz Big Cinema! As a Beginner, you are a Free Wlid for all The Idiots who go hunting With Tanks, Planes and heavy Weapons. Or you suddenly get Millions from an Unknown-and then get kicked by the oh so infallible Anti-cheat system and, if necessary, blocked it, as you got illegal InGame money. Suuper! Motivation high 10 so to speak:-/
All the Updates are only available to buy even more Cash Cards, because as a normal mortal you can't buy the whole stuff anyway.
In Summary, you have to say: If you want to play the game as a Single-player, you should strike when it is in the Sale, for example (like me). If YOU want to play MP, choose another Game, there are really better ones than the whole Pay-to-Win Remembrance here.
And how to rate now? Difficult. SinglePlayer I highly recommend, but since only updates come out for the MP there are a fummy Down.
Sorry, Rock Star, but you guys are too Money hungry for me."
"A fun story with 3 memorable characters, a fun world to mess around in and apparently the multiplayer is based"
yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooit good
"I only recommend half of this game. If you're interested in primarily the online, do not get your hopes up. It is extremely grindy and monetized like a free to play game. Most missions are bland and largely not worth doing from both a reward and fun perspective. Lobbies are also plagued with griefers and hackers.<br/><br/>Now onto the good half, story mode. Story mode offers a fun narrative with decent set pieces. The structure of the game does feel dated though. I know the game is called Grand theft Auto but there is so much brain dead driving back and forth, only being made somewhat bearable when dialogue is happening. Almost every mission, you need to drive to, then watch a cutscene, then drive somewhere else to do some shooting (or some other set piece); rinse and repeat. However, when you are not doing an excessive amount of driving, the missions are pretty enjoyable. Side missions though are a mixed bag. Some are good and others you're driving a slow tow truck to cover someone's job. Despite, all my gripes I still had a very good time with this game and I'd like to attribute this to the larger than life characters, heists, and set pieces."
"Kind of a modern classic. Whether playing the entire story is worth it, its undoubtedly influential and a pinnacle of open world destruction fun."
"I hate to give this game an exceptional, since it has changed rockstar from a video game company to a gtaonline company, but like damn.  This game is so good, both the single player and the online get an exceptional from me."
If you play the stroy you're going to enjoy it so much. The plot is very interesting and it maintains you hooked to the game. The secondary missions are enjoyable and they give you some more lore to the title. The online is not the best part at all but you can try it with some friends to be a little bit more fun. It gave me 44 hours of action and fun.
A must-play game for everyone. GTA 5 is so dynamic that will always feel yourself driving and chilling on roads.
The latest Grand Theft Auto game continues to have it's name driven further and further into the mud by it's online counterpart's predatory practices but the singleplayer remains as unapologetic and purely fun as it ever was. The game is an explosive heist movie that encourages destruction but knows when to tone down the wackiness and insert some real character moments. You can say what you want but the fact that I know Los Santos's downtown district and Bay Area better than I know my own city's streets despite living here my whole life is testament to its greatness.
